It was in a great location so easy to get to anywhere The concierge was very helpful .  Breakfast.  Location friendly staff.  I am sorry I liked every thing AVERY pleasent.  The staff is excellent Ready to help always The food was very good fresh and the idea of supper is also very good the hotel is very clean the rooms are big enough One get full value for money .  By stander infront of mcdo.  Very affordable hotel in paris with pool transfort nearby.  Had to pay extra on departure apparently bookings com gave us the wrong price .  Great room and location for winter wonderland and shopping.  Only buffet food for a kitchen open till 10 30 this is pretty poor for a hotel which has 300 plus room At least have a bar menu were i can order some snacks .  The room.  Almost had to put up with the room for wheelchair people although they claimed it is a standard room but I d be very upset if I hadn t got to change to a normal standard room .  Location was good modern building great views if u get the right rooms Staff has been very friendly and helpful .  The only let down was the shower not very strong and the view was less than desired but that may have been my fault as I requested a quiet room .  The breakfast was wonderful so fresh and a wide variety the location was awesome and so much to see and great restaurants dotted around And the receptionist was delightful and helpful The positives FAR OUTWAY the negatives. No Negative.  Hotel is in an excellent location with bus and tube station 2 minutes away The room was small but finished to a very high standard The staff were extremely friendly and helpful The only downside was there was no bar in the hotel but it should be completed soon .  The electrics were a little unpredictable something put to charge didn t charge change to another socket and success Use the same working socket later on and it wouldn t work but a different socket would Odd .  The friendliness of the staff the inclusion of wine tasting and snacks in the evening brought guests together The room was spacious stylish and well equipped with rooftop views Would enjoy staying here again .  All in all good but a little impersonal check in process but very nice check out Breakfast is very expensive if not included in the price but is excellent .  Bed and bathroom excellent and the view from the breakfast room alone worth a stay .  Breakfast is still expensive .  Just a few steps from Prater comfortable large rooms nice wellness area on the top .  Nothing.  Everything.  the bed was making squeaking noise. No Positive.  Wasn t made clear at all about the swimming pool and its facilities No mention of changing rooms lockers etc or even if there was a charge to use it .  Environment atmosphere and room and facilities.  Nothing.  Bed was comfortable.  There was no lounge area.  Bed was very comfortable Breakfast area was very nice Location .  Nothing.  Room layout quiet area comfy bed lovely food in the restaurant.  This is a tired hotel and how it can be referred to as boutique as it s part of the Hyatt chain is anyones guess The rooms we re ok but not well looked after with splashes of paint on the walls with the toilet sounding like a steam train as it uses some sort of vacuum method which takes a minimum of two flushes unique experience but not a good one The glass next to the lift was smashed the booking in process is literally in the dark in that the staff have to help as you can t see what your doing due to poor lighting The room whilst adequate in size for a short stay was again tired with paint splashes on walls toilet seat in need of replacement and the phone in the bathroom of poor quality and definitely not giving the place a 5 star feeling What really shocked me was the 5 star rating no way 5 star prices in that the breakfast was an eye watering and shocking 31 50 This is a 3 possibly due to it s location and 7 restaurants 4 stars but having travelled quite a bit it can t be classed as 5 stars .  Staff were helpful and friendly The hotel is situated next to the Liverpool Street mainline and underground stations with historic sites eateries pubs and the famous Spitalfields only a minutes walk Valet parking is available for 45 00 The hotel has 7 restaurants .  Nil.  The service was to a very good standard The location of the hotel allowed for easy access to the tube with only a 5 minute walk .  The cocktail bar gets very busy particularly late in the evening and so the service declines accordingly which is a pity More bar staff would help obviously .  very comfortable beds good check in friendly staff nice cocktails fast lifts free Smarties and right next door to the venue for the gig we went to which is why we chose this hotel .  The room we initially had did not smell very nice and we had to be moved .  The room was very nice and d cor pleasing.  Nothing.  I liked the location of the hotel very near to amsterdam sloterdijk train station where u can reach amsterdam central station one stop only and from there u can go everywhere also its 10 min by train from the airport and 20 min by taxi I liked too the decor of the hotel generally especially the room rooms are very comfortable The staff was very friendly and always smiling .  When we reached we booked a smoking room facility but there was a lot of noise i think they were doing maintenance it was shock for us then we called and asked to stop it they said it will be stopped around 5pm and we checked it around 12pm so they changed the room for us but with no smoking facility which makes us go the roof or stand outside the hotel to smoke it doesn t bother us much since we were outside all the time .  The Location was perfect the staff were so friendly and helpful the roof was amazing and the view was so beautiful the shower was so good and the hot water was amazing the breakfast was perfect with variety of cheese and bread it was so calm and there was nothing to bother at all i recommend it for people with enough budget . No Negative.  friendly staff helping me to clarify invoice and help with how get to town and all 3 ladies very beautiful .  No hot water window at a construction place elevator didn t work room smells like sigaret bathroom for handicapped people wasn t comfortable. No Positive.  Booked a three bed room which wasnt available when we arrived Fortunately a co worker had a twin room and was able to accommodate the third person We accepted this for the first night of eight nights and checked on two more occasions whether we needed to change to our triple room We were told we could stay put if we liked and they would leave us in those rooms despite the fact the accommodating co worker was checking out one night before us We were happy with that as the rooms were well positioned Then on the last night no one seemed to be aware of this agreement due to lack of communication between their staff We were told one of the rooms had to be vacated because they were fully booked and they also had no triple rooms available despite out booking We had to pack our co workers belongings out and after we some discussion they placed us in a disabled room that could accommodate a third bed They also refunded the difference between a double and a triple room for the duration of our stay and threw in the safe key charge for free after we demanded they discuss that with the manager .  Location Functional Front room balconies look out over street . No Negative.  Bed great breakfast delicious great choices.  No sleep kit in the room this time as have had it before but not sure if this is still provided in the room .  Excellent location for Greenwich O2 Westfield DLR and Emirates skyline Lovely spacious rooms clean and comfortable Nice city views Brilliant breakfast Lovely staff Professional and friendly . No Negative.  Friendly staff Very courteous and helpful Quick response to questions .  We had problems at the start because we didn t have the card used to pay for the reservation it was a present from someone else But we were offered a solution and everything worked out well in the end .  Everything was great The room was big clean cozy Maria and the rest of the staff were really great and accommodating It was my birthday and I couldn t have been happier when I saw the room and what the hotel had prepared . No Negative.  Good view to the river Set up of the hotel and the service provided.  Very crowded there are many conferences in the hotel.  Great localization if you look for the base for moving around Catalonia literaly on top od Barcelona Sants train station Good breakfast selection i especially recomend smoothies Star Wars design of the hotel .  Slightly small room .  Bed incredibly comfy .  The bathroom without any wings to throw out air there was a small window but air doesn t change a lot .  Price and the staff was really kind . No Negative.  Lovely staff and great location Very comfortable bed and breakfast was delicious Would stay again when next in London.  Room and facilities.  Nothings.  Nothing.  The location Clean Restaurants and cafes around Room is small but comfortable.  Nothing.  The room was nice and all the staff was excellent. No Negative.  We always have a great time here Excellent location and great service management The hotel might be better suited for a bit older kids rather than toddlers We went to patisserie Paul every morning just around the corner for the best breakfast croissants and coffee The hotel breakfast is quite good too but not worth the money to be honest Bonus they have great fish n chips in the hotel restaurant The cutest area for evening strolls is South Kensington a 5 7 min slow walk or 2 stops with the bus where you can find good restaurants and great ice cream open late When reserving a room ask for a newly refurbished executive room they are great .  Would have been good to have leisure facilities.  The staff were excellent and very helpful My husband hurt his leg running the marathon and everyone at the hotel couldn t have been more helpful to us .  Twin beds pushed together although comfortable when asked for a double room .  Very friendly and helpful staff Great location for city site seeing Fabulous breakfast .  Unstable wi fi.  Location in the central 8th arrondissement. No Negative.  Staff were incredibly helpful . No Negative.  great position close to the metro stop and the public transport to reach the airport nice buffet breakfast and cordiality of the staff.  expensive.  Excellent location friendly staff.

The single room was really small and felt like needed a refresh.  Great location and staff.  The only thing I suppose I could say bad about the hotel was the price of drinks from the mini bar in our room were Very Expensive But that s not much of a problem as there is a Tesco Express practically next door .  We stayed here as we were seeing a show at the 02 which is just one stop away on the tube Just a 2 minute walk over a footbridge is the Canary Wharf tube station Which is also connected to a shopping centre Breakfast was Lovely The bar area and restaurant also Good .

Very comfortable the hotel s comfort balanced a slightly longer journey to the center by public transport The hotel is reachable by night lines The hotel is my favorite for the next trip Breakfast Excellent .  The beds were too soft and we both woke up with sore backs .  Decor.  There is simply nothing to dislike.  If I could have given 11 out of 10 I would have Having travelled to many 4 and 5 star hotels for business and leisure I can say what sets this hotel apart is their wonderful staff and incredible attention to detail They are so helpful and always greet you with a smile The roof terrace with pool is fantastic and turns a city break into a twin centre holiday allowing you to take in the sights of Barcelona in the day returning to relax by the pool in the afternoon I will definitley be returning .  Very expensive Charged 1 60 for the call I made to order room service .  Great location Comfortable room .

Great staff and nice rooms .  If I was really fussy I d say the lack of a fridge mini bar was the only thing I missed Nothing at all to complain about .  Just a ten minute walk from the Eiffel tower and with views of the tower itself from the room this hotel was an excellent choice Loved the decor very nice staff comfortable quiet despite the metro running outside Great location for walking to cafes and restaurants near many sights and with two metro lines running outside Hope to come back to Paris again soon and Le Parisis will be my first choice .  Staff attitude.  Breakfast location gym. No Negative.  Friendly and helpful staff exellent breakfast My request was met with a smile. No Negative.  Cannot fault the staff who all made sure the disabled person in our party was accommodated Special mention to the Concierge who arranged parking and was very helpful The breakfast was very good with a wide range of choices Rooms were clean and comfortable .

The location is very easy accessible to South Ken underground museums Harrods all walking distance Hyde Park very close by Use of the library and quiet zones in the hotel was delightful Very good standard rooms quality of linen bathroom decoration was very cosy Helpful staff friendly .

Location is pretty good Personnel was very friendly and helpful e g printed boarding passes We had a terrace with chairs and a table which we enjoyed very much .  Nothing .  The room is good and well kept.  The fire alarm episode on 23 June 2016 was appalling poor communication by front desk staff .  The location is superb right by the Tube and close to grocery stores and restaurants .  Room was very small and we were right near the lift and the noise was horrendous .  Great location Really easy to get around London .  .  The room was very nice and very clean Bed very comfortable The hotel is accessible via tram 2 station in front of hotel and is 25 30 min from Central Station depends on traffic The free Wi fi works good .  There is nothing about this hotel that I didn t like .  The staff were excellent went above and beyond to make our stay so enjoyable They even sang happy birthday to my partner on his birthday with a cake They also gave us a complimentary cocktail which was again a lovely touch Will definitely go back to Westcord Fashion Hotel Food was exceptional especially steak .  We had a small claustrophobic room next to the noisy road with a questionable air con system and the shower did not work An engineer failed to repair it and after several cold showers we were moved to a new quieter and better room the next day and were compensated for the inconvenience .  Great location for what we needed Beautiful exterior and lobby and bar area.  I think it is better if the price room to be lower .  Nice staf nice location nice room nice fasilities .  I think it would have been really nice if the hotel could play some light music in the reception area while enjoying the delicious free buffet they had on offer not just the television .  Couldn t fault the staff and the cleanliness of the hotel Perfect location for us quiet and relaxing On our welcome we were surprised with cava and little messages during our stay that was a bonus .  The room was tiny the shower didn t have a door or curtain so when you took a shower the water got everything wet the breakfast buffet wasn t ready on time all 3 days We had to wait outside for her to open the door 15 min and then only half the food was out There was only AC in your room so the moment you open your door it would suck the air out of your lungs .  Very close to shopping. No Negative.  Great hotel amazing staff perfect location great bar and gym Will most certainly stay here again .  Hotel was spotless.  Didn t eat there. No Negative.  Good value for money.  The bed was the hardest thing I have ever slept on not firm just hard and the pillows were dreadful No tea or coffee making facilities and if you wanted a cuppa you had to run down to reception and wait for someone to be free to make a cup at 3 a pop With price paid I would have expected better Room service menu was of a particular genre and couldn t really disguise itself as a meal you would have been hungry 2 hours later Room was beside the lift and therefore we had noise everytime someone used the lift on the upper floors Balcony was nice to have paid for that but could have had cushion available for chair or lounger Location was ok only 5 min walk to Segrada Familia but for most other things you had to travel .  The staff were friendly and room was clean .  Breakfasr was expensive .  Location in the cetre but still quiet room .  Value for money.  Convenience for Gare du Nord.

Very tentative and polite staff The tablet in the room was very helpful in requesting the complementary gifts and wine recommended by the bar staff was lovely We will definitely be back . No Negative.  great service great location .  A bit out from the center but tram is convenient Breakfast has a good variety but it should come for free as the hotel is already expensive .  Rooms have a very nice design and are very conformable Tram is just outside the hotel so it is very convenient in rainy Amsterdam You can buy tram tickets for multiple days from the reception .  Not many tissues towels or bins .  Comfy pillows ambient lighting free galaxy hot chocolate provided brilliant view .  No microwave and the size of bed is too small Also no refrigerator for storing food and drinks.  Location.  I had to put in the wifi password every time I wanted to use it even after a few minutes The hotel was a little difficult to find because the name on the door is different .  Lovely spacious reception and breakfast area Nice balcony Friendly staff The breakfast offered a good variety .  Had loud people above room 508 our final night.  The staff all the way.  The price of wifi and parking too expensive when staying for one night .  Pleasant clean helpful all good .  I did not like the location of this hotel .  The room was clean and nice . No Negative.  Very comfortable bed in well designed room Very well maintained and excellent housekeeping Good views over the Ij and city .  Continental breakfast was 8 50 in addition to room rent.  Stylish little hotel courteous staff willing to help good location near a tube station decent breakfast.  Again booking is not showing that the actual hotel is not an old building it s just the facade The name let s you hope for real 18th century but no photos of the architecture inside in our bathroom there were not all products a bit sloppy check out .  the location is fabulous central and jet very quite Rooms have atmosphere a little oldish but stylish not too small may be not super clean since there is this all over carpet but O K .  Very narrow bed constant noise from the fan and from the outside since window couldn t be closed properly Heating broken and had to resort to small spaceheater .  Very clean reasonable walking distance to the tube .  The in room fridge was broken and inaccessible The bedside lights didn t work or were unfathomable .  The hotel and rooms were lovely .

The breakfast room very tiny as in the basement not airy.  Great Location Staff very helpful The girl who checked us in was very charming The hotel was very busy during our stay and special thanks to manager Prashant who helped us when we needed an extra room urgently The location is too good piccadilly leister square next to the hotel The room that we stayed in was good spacious The bathroom was spacious too I think it was the club room People who cannot locate the hotel its next to queens theatre The hotel is soon going to start a spa maybe in a week or two that sounds great I would love to book again. No Negative.  wow This hotel is the new standard for hotels Everything was so modern and efficient I would love to come back many times here.  Being a left handed eater I found the design of cutlery slightly difficult to use but all you need to do is ask for a different set and they can provide this for you The Hotel was slightly set back from the Main Street with a 10 minute walk to the nearest tube but this was no problem for us and fine if you like a good walk I really don t have anymore faults for this hotel .  The staff were so friendly and attentive The room was spotless and of a good size Beds were extremely comfy and spacious if you like to spread out We felt really welcome and had special arrangements made for us for when we arrived which were no trouble at all The bar staff were very good at their jobs and the maids took extra care with every fine detail Overall one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in around London and I am unsure why it isn t a 5 . No Negative.  Most of staff are helpful .  Room wasn t great for the cost but okay Lift was not running to all floors.  Nice staff.  There was a bad smell in the room may be it from the bathroom.  The reception staff was good except the luggage guy His name Joseph was very friendly and helpful he deserves to be at the front office.  The one room we had was right off the elevator so there was noise from that Not really loud but if you were awake you could hear it .  The hotel is in a great location and the staff is very helpful and kind It is well run and there is always someone available at the front desk.  There was a strange smell on the corridor after you got out of the lift didn t effect our room as it wasn t near the lifts but i imagine rooms close had a smell.  Location for sightseeing is best thing about this hotel very polite staff and lovely comfy beds.  Nothing.

I had a great rest there very comfortable beds and amazingly delicious breakfast with tasty coffee and bread Room is well furnished and quite big for a hotel In addition my personal thanks to the personell of the hotel who gave us a kettle to the room when my husband cought cold so we could make hot tea ourselves without running to the bar all the time Thank you for your support .

We came to hotel so tired after night train trip It was early in the morning they had no room but they let us know in short period room is ready and we had nap and were ready to see Vienna.  Would have liked coffee facilities .  Lovely big bed great towels and shower.  Bad fitting Windows let in a lot of outside noise .  Staff were very attentive and helpful.  Please include directions from Eiffel Tower metro station .  Perfectly located for Bastille Day festivities at Eiffel Tower .  The price is inconsistent from one week to the next making it very difficult to book consecutive weeks Breakfast is very hectic sometimes to the point that I didn t even bother .  Location and local transport facilities are excellent Staff are excellent .  Paying for parking.  Very easy check in.  the only disappointment for us was the fact hat we were unable to use the rooftop terrace We were there as part of a number of trips to celebrate our 50th and 60th Birthdays and would have love to have had champagne on the roof top terrace Unfortunately this was not to be and nothing pre warned us of this Quite disappointing .  The Hotel the room 606 the staff all excellent We did not eat in so I could not comment on the food The bar service and atmosphere excellent Comfy Bed clean and quiet room all excellent .

No Positive.  Can t say there was anything we didn t like .  Extremely welcoming Breakfast was amazing And to top it off we had a bottle of presecco in our room for my husband birthday from the staff .  It was my 30th birthday husband rang ahead and spoke to someone to arrange champagne and flowers in room as a surprise and it didn t happen Total let down and husband felt bad it not happening.  Lovely location and restaurant staff were lovely. No Negative.  The location was close to every where would you like to go etc shops Coffee shop Fast foods night life people in the street .  The standard bedrooms are a good standard but don t reflect the history or grandeur of the building.  Beautiful historic building great dining and professional staff.  Aircon for cold did not work. No Positive.  Bed a bit hard but that s personal choice.  Excellent location very clean bedroom and bathroom very good choice at breakfast very polite and helpful staff Would stay again.  The shower over flowed when you used it but this was more of a mess for the staff than bothering us .  Really enjoyed our stay at the Novotel Paris the staff couldn t have been more helpful and friendly especially the concierge he went out of his way to help us and we didn t even buy any tickets off of him because we had them booked before hand not because we are mean lol The location is also a major plus as you can walk to the Eiffel tower in 10 15 mins but you have a metro less than 10 mins away We would really recommend the Novotel Paris its fab And the beds are really comfortable .  wifi slow and no reach.  location is excellent.  Room was very cold despite having the aircon turned off There was no hot water to speak of despite running it as advised for more than 10 minutes an incredible waste of water the room door did not lock at all Did discount the bill at checkout but I suspect they knew the room was below par .  Location.  The ground floor entrance was smelly and of poor decor with stains on walls.  Staff were really helpful Good breakfast.  Lack of movie channels documentries was really dissapointing the only reason why i wouldnt return .  Pleasant staff across all areas Room was well appointed without being over the top . No Negative.  Nice decor throughout.  A bit far away from the center Rent a bike or take an Uber .  Everything is just fine great value for money .  None.  Friendly staff Not a super luxury hotel but good atmosphere and clean .  A little bit expensive small elevator .

Location to the stadium . No Negative.  Large comfortable room.  No hairdryers in the ladies changing rooms of the spa .  Room was stunning decor room controls were brilliant Room service was excellent. No Negative.  the ambience of the property location feasibility just one station from the central station even I like the hospitality of the restaurant chef I m vegetarian and he had made a special meal for me thank you .  The bed was too soft It was hard to regulate the temperature to cool the room down And it was too noisy outside to keep the windows open However when the windows were closed it was quiet in the room .

No Negative.  great hotel in an excellent location room was very nice and had a view of the Roman wall The pool and spa is great . No Negative.

The staff was very helpful and friendly The room was very large and comfortable Nice breakfast .  No Car Park we knew that and made alternative arrangements however it needs to be recorded as a downside Please note there is a small area by the entrance foyer where you can leave the car for the time it takes to check in so there is no worry carrying car luggage .  Great Breakfast in the Jamies Restaurant attached to the hotel Upgrade to Executive and then enjoy complimentary drinks in the Exec lounge .  Rooms look a bit dated .  Comfortable and clean lovely bar and seating area Friendly check in staff .  Kitchen were unwilling to make me a club sandwich because they were busy After a little argument they eventually sent it up Not good for a hotel in my opinion .  Location Free Wifi Staff.  Having to sit on the floor to dry my hair as the cord for the hairdryer was very short No decent mirror in the bathroom and where to put anything in the bathroom .  The staff.  Breakfast has 2 options Continental basically bread and pastries for 28 Euros or American the continental plus cold meets and smoked salmon for 38 Euros Both way too much money for what s on offer .  Staff ambience and location all excellent Would go again .  Small room no sitting area in the loppy Check in at 3 pm instead of 12 Long time for checking in.  Only location is good.  It would be good if a simle brekfast could be included in the price.  The staff were very heloful and upgraded us withoutasking.  The bed was hard and lumpy paint was peeling and furniture was beyond outdated Breakfast was barely palatable .  The view of the Eiffel Tower was fabulous and the staff was really helpful and pleasant . No Negative.  A great location with easy access via the many transport systems available within a short distance Some great shops bars and restaurants close by also Brilliant views from the roof top pool area of the city .  The room is too small and some of the rooms are too complicated to find . No Positive.  It was a shame to have to close the very expensive curtains during the day for privacy as there weren t any nets or blinds at the large window For a 5 star hotel one would expect a welcome bottle or two of water to be provided especially on a hot day .  Excellent location Although the room was at the rear and the view was of other buildings it was peaceful especially as there is a lot of nightlife in the area The refurbishment is of the highest quality and many original features of the building retained There was even a mobile phone in the room so you could make calls within Europe free of charge The internet connection was very good Large on the wall flat screen TV with satellite Large modern shower There is also a swimming pool but we did not realise this before we arrived .  The only point I would say is if you have allergies to perfume then the reception area is heavily perfumed so just be aware.  Amazing location close to great cafes and restaurants in Montmatre Staff and room were fantastic.  Would like bar restaurant improved.  Good location. No Negative.  The staff were very friendly and the hotel very nice The room was very quiet and clean Good location too . No Negative.

No Lounge a 4 star Hotel should look and feel like same. No Positive. No Negative.  Close to metro station Good staffs good breakfast room is clean and comfortable karlzplats is 20min walks or two stops by metro good value against money .  Breakfast was truly terrible Only one cup of coffee instead of two The same for orange juice Very poor quality of food Limited bread options Not good for the hotel that caliber .  Some staff members went out of their way to help .  Can NOT think of anything.  Room very nice clean and quiet Staff very helpful Great location Shuttle service excellent Good value and I will return when traveling to Europe again .  A little disappointed in the room Poorly laid out Poor lighting especially in the bathroom Bed linen could be improved and the terrace lacked privacy and protection from the wind .  Fantastic view Excellent Restaurant and bar .  AC is a little temperamental if you like a cool room leave window open for the day to cool it first.

Very friendly and helpful staff Delicious breakfast Great location Fast WIFI.  Nothing negative.  Definitely we will stay to this hotel when we visit Vienna again Very polite and helpful personnel Clean rooms with modern decoration Very reach breakfast worth the extra cost when booking a room Centrally located very close to key attractions like History of Art Natural History Museums Museumsquartier Town hall Parliament key Christmas markets if you visit Vienna during Christmas From the hotel it is Max 15 20 min walk to the city center worth to do it cause you enjoy city architecture A Metro station is very close to the hotel approx 200 meters .

Food was awful Ordered a steak with bearnaise sauce No bearnaise sauce Chef tried to pass off balsamic reduction as bearnaise sauce Dessert advertised with clotted cream and fresh fruit came with canned whipped cream and tinned fruit Hugely disappointed Small amount of money was taken off the bill but token was no where near enough .  Nice lounge area .  The single room was too small you couldn t plug in your chargers or appliances as the plugs were hidden at the back of a fitted unit next to bed I performed contornists moves to plug In the fan there was also a glass top that overhung the unit which caught on your leg getting in and out of bed The breakfast room was too small for the number of people using it. No Positive.  Check in time 3pm wasn t too bad as they have luggage storage so you can explore No iron in the room Not enough sun beds around the pool area .  Best location to be central in the heart of las Ramblas Perfect for shopping bars restaurants etc Right next to plaza catalunya and other main attractions close by Swimming pool is an okay size plus the spa facilities Will definitely stay here again when coming back to Barcelona .  Yes rooms are compact lol but very clean and to be fair when you visit London you are only really putting your head down so don t actually spend that much time in the room Well I don t anyways .  The location was absolutely fantastic couldn t have got better Rooms were lovely and clean and lots of character within the hotel .  It was perfect My only observation was that there was only one robe in the room and we were three female friends sharing We did request more but they did not arrive It wasn t a problem though .  The hotel was beautiful Recently refurbished it was very modern but still very welcome and friendly . No Negative.  Location Facilities The transportation ticket .  They served the same brrakfast every day and it wasnt great .  The locations was withing walking distance to La Sagrada Familia The metro station Marina was neaby The staff was excelent they helped me take the breakfast in the room The internet conection was great and the room was spacious .  The breakfast was not included in our stay and was not offered after booking We chose an a la carte breakfast of just 2 poached eggs bacon one slice and toast one slice We were then informed it would be cheaper to go for the 25 full English breakfast even though there was nothing else we wanted Seemed a huge amount to pay as this was all we ate probably our most expensive breakfast in terms of what we ate The waiter then got our breakfast from the buffet 15 minutes after ordering it The poached eggs tasted of vinegar and there was too much soft fat on the bacon Some of the waiting staff spoke little English Upon leaving we paid for all our sundries and were then expected to pay parking When I booked a few months ago parking was included in the cost of the hotel and was told that the terms had later changed This had to be waived .  Location was excellent for the O2 and the bar on the 18th floor was amazing in terms of its views The room was comfortable and clean .  The hotel is very big and we had to walk a fair way to our room from the hotels however that s not the end of the world .  Good location close to the museum quarter Staff were excellent and we were quickly shown to our room well before check in time The room was a strange layout with space around the bed a bit cramped however the bathroom was very big and a nice addition of having the chairs to sit at to enjoy the free minibar.  Nothing Everything was amazing .  Words cannot express the amazingness that is this hotel From the moment we walked in to the moment we checked out the service has been by far the best i have ever received at a hotel The room was beautiful bathroom is gorgeous the hotel is just breathtaking My husband and i were set to elope in the city but due to the rain they let us use the library for our vows and let us take professional pictures around the hotel They treated us like royalty and we cannot wait to return .  The staff was rude and stuck up Got my booking all wrong at check in No fridge in the room and the car park gate was a hassle.  The ferry crossing was free and very convenient and the view from the bar outside was beautiful.  The Spa was way too small and is also open to the public The 30 cost for the spa should be included in the room price it is very overrated by looking at pictures on the website We had to call reception a number of times for things that should have been put in our room that wasn t .  The comfort of the hotel room was ok and the staff were great .  I didn t like that we had to pay 150 for incidentals which I was not aware about which took away a big chunk of our spending money and then when we went to get our money back when we checked out they had taken a city tax out of it Which would have been fine if we had of been told about it on arrival or before hand Just another thing I had booked a double room but arrived to find two single beds with a huge gap in between which I wouldn t count as a double bed Other than that good hotel.  Very friendly staff and very clean modern hotel.  Not enough shelf space for twop.  Bathroom facility good.  We were told the restaurant closed at 11 00 pm but when we arrived for food at 10 30 pm there was only a very limited choice available Would have been good to have bath robes in our bathroom and 2 of the bathroom tiles were cracked and we had to ask for a remote for the TV.  We were visiting Wembley Arena for a show and it was ideally placed and we were able to get early check in for no additional cost Reception staff were friendly and helpful .  Shame there is no pool.  Fabulous staff great bar wonderful breakfast and afternoon tea.  The property is very old All the furniture are very unlike and the design of the room looks like in mid ages The door of toilet was really damage and unpainted The toilet and the room spells really bad I paid around 370 euro for one night for my myself my wife and my son And what i got was really far from this price. No Positive.  Pillows hard Evening staff on desk could not answer question about night buses New location better than they did However did eventually look it up and find answer.

Helpful staff.  People amd lcation was very good but the Room was small . No Positive. No Negative.  Incredible hotel very friendly staff they gave us a bottle of Cava on check in because it was my husband s birthday Couldn t have done more to make our stay more perfect .  The bed was a double which we found quite small and high we haven t slept in a double bed for quite a few years would of preferred a king size bed I would have given a 10 if there was a spa facility on site and a larger bed in the room .  Very friendly professional welcome and offered a free glass of champagne upon arrival Our room had a lovely welcome note with a complimentary room spray oscars bar served amazing cocktails great staff and atmosphere .  Airconditioning was a bit annoying Caught a lil cold the last night .  The whole staff was exceptionally friendly Absolutely recommendable for everyone who s looking for a at home feeling during their holiday .  The air conditionering made too much noise .  Very frendly straff Good beds .  Perhaps include breakfast for the price.  Extremely clean and comfortable excellent customer service.  No.  Nice hotel.

Noise from the street Very simple breakfast selection .  Confortable for 2 person Clean rooms bathroom There s a microwave in the room It s very close to metro too .  One morning breakfast service wasn t very good and my son couldn t even make a cup of tea because the machines were acting up The the sound of the underground directly below our room was a bit unnerving .  The location.  information help where to park the car.  location location location price quality charming .  Despite the luxury a bit pricey .  This was such an amazing experience from the size of the room to the bath in the sky The quality of everything was superb and even the little details well planned eg the binoculars and the staff very smart friendly and professional We sat up late just to take in the awesome views of London at night.  everything a perfect .

The hotel staff were excellent they were always willing to help or even have a friendly chat with you The location was brilliant We were walking distance to everything The staff at the bar American were amazing and made us feel part of Amsterdam however the Cafe Americain despite it s stunning interior were not so welcoming and their selection of food was rather restricted poor vegetarian choices The hotel itself was beautiful and extremely well maintained and the rooms were lovely but the mattress was very soft and the toilet paper was rather poor quality We would return as our holiday was made pleasurable because of the hotel staff the location and the wonderfully historic building .  Would have been good to have drinking water in the room . No Positive.  AC was split and so far from the bed breakfast wasn t included .  I like the room it was big and relaxing also the stuff were lovely Accepting the booking online without a credit card wad wonderful.

The staff were very friendly and helpful Bank machine right across the street Rooms were beautifully done up Right next to subway station .

Friendly staff very helpful. No Negative.  Ideal location to the beach lovely area. No Negative.  Some of the staff at the lobby attitude not so good but some staff are good and friendly Breakfast option is very limited No options for egg choice or sausages .

Location perfect to use public transport to get around Breakfast excellent Roof terrace a very nice place for a drink .  Possibly more glasses in the room we needed to ask a few times In room or lobby complementary coffee would have made it perfect Closer to a metro might have been nice but just a few short blocks walk to MADELINE .  Very comfortable rooms comfy beds quiet great bathroom facilities separate toilet room Lots of storage very clean Towel warmer a nice touch Expert staff gorgeous dining room and bar Would highly recommend to anyone .  Bathrooms to small No wash cloth in bathroom .  Staff was very friendly and accomodating and the hotel location close to trains and public transport I also love the concept of the mobile phone provided in each room which was free and could use in place of maps Also phone provided 5 free calls internationally .  although with this price but not a tower view breakfast so expensive .  really perfect location 3mins to river 15 mintues to ef tower by foot 6mins to champs elysees nice lobby comfortable bed cute elevator .  The air conditioning in the bedroom could have been a lot colder Both nights we practically over heated even with the fan on full and the temp on low Also the toilet flush button didn t work properly it needed a lot of strength to push the button inwards and hold it there till the toilet had finished its flush .  The cookie Haha The room service cleaning The members of staff were polite and helpful The layout design was modern good looking The lift bedroom keyless card system.  Room was quite small but I guess that s typical for London The main problem was that our key cards did not work and had to be changed out several times Even then we could only get them to work 3 out of 4 times on average .  Staff were very friendly and accommodating .  Breakfast was a bit poor all the time you need wait at least 15 min order and wait but was tasty.  Room was clean have a nice view quite.  Small space .

They burnt candles in the hotel and it was intoxicating A very sickening smell may be to cover the smell in the street which smelt like sewerage .  The staff were great. No Negative.  Great beds and chance to upgrade at a reasonable price .  There is a charge to use the sauna steam room at the pool felt this was unnecessary Location slightly further out than we would have preferred but we knew this upon booking .  The staff were very friendly and helpful right from check in to check out Comfortable rooms very clean and we enjoyed having access to the pool and fitness suite Breakfast good variety and fairly good quality We visited Amsterdam with my brother and his wife to celebrate his 30th Birthday we were given a voucher for 4 free cocktails at Skyy Bar a nice gesture Very good food drinks at both lobby restaurant and Skyy Bar Location was out of the main city centre but tram stop very close by with 1 and 17 providing great access to lots of attractions Did not get a chance to use the bikes available for hire but they would be another good option for getting around Only a short drive from the airport Overall good value for money particularly since it was during New Year weekend First time staying in a Westcord would definitely stay again .  Same as above .  The service at the reception desk .  Small rooms.  Location is good. No Negative.  Perfect for gig in O2. No Negative.  The hotel has a great location close to hyde park and multiple bus stops and train stations Highly recommended .  Staff were harassed poorly trained and grumpy with only one notable exception I asked for a strong coffee in the morning this was refused twice and when I asked again if it may be possible to have a stronger coffee the coffee served was the colour of weak tea the waitress brought me a sachet of nescafe and told me I could tip it into the cup The evening receptionist was too busy slamming down telephones and was extremely harassed and angry when I arrived The morning receptionist made up for it by being very understanding and arranging for a refund for my breakfast .

Long walk from tune station The bistro did not open till 11 30 and closed at 11pm The breakfast area and bars seemed to small for all the guests Breakfast had only one toaster totally insufficient for the number of people.  Position was good for view of bridge erc.  Cleanliness could be improved as we found that a towel and a cup had not been cleaned properly Nothing serious but it stood out in contrast to the high standard of the hotel .

Being upsold at check in to a larger room with breakfast included I didn t need the larger room nor could I have ever eaten enough to justify the premium charged I was jet lagged and easily manipulated I was made to feel like I was being done a favour when it was really a disservice Naked coed sauna was also a surprise .

Area.  Location.

The location and breakfast.  We were provided the room which was not even cleaned properly I wouldn t expect a dirty toilet even in a 2 star hotel We showed the picture to the staff and then we were later moved to different room On Friday night we ordered Indian Chicken curry from their menu and it turned out to be a disaster Probably it was our mistake to have ordered Indian dish there in Amsterdam but we were craving for Indian food Basic things like shower caps etc were not there Over all it didn t meet my expectations as I feel it wasn t value for money .  Location was good as it was close to the station and city centre was walkable Sky lounge was a good experience .  the food at breakfast was cold there are lifts at the hotel but you still have to walk up stairs to get to your room and to the restaurant my husband has bad legs and stairs are a big problem .  staff are friendly .

We were very happy with the Mercure Eiffle Tower It s excellent location is a very short walk to the Juval Station which easily takes you to Versailles or the sites along the Seine The closest bridge has the Statue of Liberty the next one is the Eiffle Tower We took the Batobus a hop on hop off boat along the Seine It took us to most of the major sites There are several nearby affordable good restaurants and the breakfast they offer in the hotel is excellent Our room was spacious with big windows which keep the noise out The bathroom was exceptional In addition their staff was very accommodating and friendly Yes we will stay there again .  Breakfests were really chaotic and our room could have been nicer .  Hotel s location was perfect and the personnel were really helpful .  Food was expensive.

It was a very nice room and friendly staff.  A bit impersonal.  Location and standard.  Carpet was very old with stains We booked a 2 bedroom suite thought that it would have a kitchenette or at least a few small appliances like a tea kettle or a coffee maker but it had no such thing Since we were travelling with a baby it was very important for us The suite we had was next to a construction zone the construction related noise in the morning was unbearable The staff should have warned us or moved to another suite .  Location courteous front desk staff .  I thought the rooms would be bigger as i reserved a room for three people but the room was too small for 3 people Reception very slow elevators are a mess carpet in the rooms are not very clean the shower in our room leaked water all over the floor also the TV didn t work the entire time we were there I reserved a room for 3 people but they only offer towels for 2 Pity as I used to like staying at the previous nikko hotel .  Good bed mattress location near all main site seeing attractions and shops .  The service was terrible at breakfast The restaurant wasn t busy but we had to wait a long time to be seated eventually had to go and find someone to seat us then we waited a long time to be served and had to actually call someone over before we were acknowledged The assumption was made that we wanted a buffet even though there was a menu to order from We had to ask for the menu We had eggs benedict and oddly there was tarragon in the hollandaise sauce but no advance warning of this .  The helpfulness if the staff at check in and check out .  Very small room and a bit noisy You could hear the lift going up and down our room was next to the lift and the steps from the upper floor .  Very good location close to 2 subway stations The staff is friendly and very helpful The breakfast is very good The portable telephone provided in the room allowing free local calls and internet is an excellent facility .  On arrival queued 20 minutes to be told that check in wasn t done at that desk Debit card swiped as cover for any extras Paid for drinks on room Friday night Saturday afternoon refused to charge to room as no credit very embarrassing Waited 30 minutes for drinks Later Saturday night accepted payment to room Letter then received to say we hadn t paid for drinks settled the bill Dirty pots left in room all weekend .  Location was ideal .  The cold modern aesthetic of the hotel did not appeal to me in the slightest Our 500 a night room was situated across from the elevator and faced a dismal interior court yard The surrounding neighborhood is all high end shops not charming markets I would not bring children to this kind of hotel .  Well located property. No Negative.  The location was perfect for the places we wanted to visit the hotel was also very modern and great value for money .  I don t like all the smokers standing in front of the door .  Great cafe for breakfast very helpful staff comfy and warm beds water bottles in room .  I liked the attempt at environmental awareness since i am an environmental consultant promoting those items however All the toilets leaked continuously not in our room but beside the restaurant and our shower sent much water on the wall when it was operating from leaks in 4 of the joints and valves but it did not impact the enjoyment of the shower .  The bed and pillows were extra comfy We are still using the complementary water bottle for our travel needs in malaga The staff were always friendly and very accomodating even with our lack of spanish .  The staff were extremely rude including the manager There was some confusion with our bar bill due to our large group however before it could be addressed I was chased out of the bar and grabbed by the barmaid demanding I pay the bill Explained we would pay this however they were insistent and continued to be rude The manager smelt strongly of smoke to the point where I had to stand away The swimming pool jets did not work and it was freezing cold and the steam room was not in working order A lovely hotel but the staff need further training Extremely disappointing . No Positive.  Room Furniture extremely scuffed part damaged by kettle steam Carpet frayed and looked like water damaged by bathroom Corridor carpet frayed and scruffy . No Positive.  Door bell is too loud in rooms as you can hear other rooms as well Locks in washrooms would be nice.  I love the breakfast espacillay yogurt with berries and crossants Excellent.  I m not sure how this hotel could get 4 stars as it definitely would not get more than 2 stars from me The customers is king at least that is what they say but the stay made me rather upset than happy First of all the parking situation is a disaster They have a car park where customers pay 28 a day which is not cheap already btw but for this you need a customer card which you obviously get in the hotel if you call in and let them know that you need a parking spot I did so but when I arrived they told me that they didnt get my message so I had to pay 50 a day which is quite heavy Besides the rooms did not look like they did on the pictures at all I was literally shocked when I saw the rooms we got It was my first stay in this hotel and there will definitely not be a second one The only good point is that the hotel is pretty central but to be honest this wasnt worth the stress we had when we arrived We came a long way from Germany and the only thing we wanted was to relax but that was sadly not possible Instead of relaxing and calming down I was even more stressed Sorry to say that this hotel ruined my stay in Paris .  The hotel was pretty Central .  Nothing.  Everything superb hotel excellent breakfast .  We had a security issue with our room door that required a maintenance call out That was not finally fixed until 01 30am so we were not impressed that we lost some sleep over that .  Luxury Feel to the Furnishings and the Friendly Attentive Front of House Staff.  rooms not very big.  location near to metro station shops around.  high price of breakfast.  Quiet comfortable clean room excellent service friendly staff and excellent location of the hotel I am happy that chose this place .  Only one staff member at the breakfast on our last day appeared to be in a bad mood which was very out of character for the majority of the staff .  From the moment we arrived the staff were extremely helpful and cheerful It was only a short walk with our cases from the station and also very near the metro The room was very big and very comfortable and the breakfast was tremendous There were many choices of meats and breads and cooked dishes Overall it was what made our stay in Barcelona even more rewarding Definitely worth doing again . No Negative.  Kind staff Great breakfast Nice location .  would have liked a bath .  comfy room and bed nice touch with water and other complimentary items for bathroom and teas .  Room was small but nicely decorated The size of the room was never an issue however we spent very little time in the room .  Staff was extremely helpful and very courteous Location very close to Metro shopping restaurants and several sites including the Louvre .  Very noisy construction site near hotel. No Positive.  the breakfast is ok but not as what i ecpect.  location is fantastic the family room is exellant.  The only reason I marked this down was that the shower was very difficult for my elderly mother to navigate No grab bars and the control knobs for the hot cold were easily bumped as you moved around in the shower .  I was traveling with my 85 year old mother for a Christmas holiday in Europe We loved our room The staff were very helpful and gracious to our needs I want to say that the front desk assistance with getting taxi room service etc was top notch I hope to visit again .  Lifts could have been more regular didn t appear to all operate .  Breakfasts were very good however on weekends there is a queue and you may well have to wait a while .  There are 2 hotels with the same name fairly close to each other which caused some confusion .  Lovely room beautiful bathroom comfortable bed and awesome aircon perfect for the heatwave .  Nothing to complain about .  Large comfortable room with great facilities .  TV channels too few .  Room clean not too small Bed warm comfy Overall very good coffee machine excellent.  Dated and stuffy.  Nice bed big room and good location.  Long queue of 12 at reception waiting to book in only 1 desk open with a member of staff .  Got upgraded with free breakfast because of long queue to book in at reception I had altered my booking on line but hotel did not have details Alessandro however apologised sincerely made me feel important smile .  These are not things that would stop us from staying here again just comments for the hotel to consider mattress was a little too hard for my liking we stayed in a family room 5 of us and you want us to reuse towels to assist with saving the environment so then please put up more towel rails hooks in the bathrooms there is plenty of space so please use it wisely .  location was brilliant central to Las Ramblas Metro stops and fantastic restaurants the hotel was clean tidy and quiet modern yet still historical staff were friendly and so helpful 24 hour reception so someone was always around to ask questions of 12pm checkout was excellent.  Short version Badly trained nervous and sloppy staff with no decision authority Bad financial administration Uncomfortable beds Long version I changed the room through booking com They didn t do the change properly so I ended up with the cheap room for the high price When I complained they didn t listen to my idea of a solution with the result that I had to change rooms halfway my stay For every change on booking com they made a reservation on my card without releasing the old one Result was that I could not pay for the room Rather than deciding to solve this later the receptionist tried for half an hour to solve it without any other result than me nearly missing my flight The staff is clearly not up to its task and had not enough decision space to solve problems they got visibly nervous when asked a non standard question and I had to ask twice for simple things like an iron .  I liked the staircase going round the elevator .  Slightly noisy at night as you could hear what s going on in the courtyard .  View across the Thames and complimentary transport to Clapham .  a little expensive.  Convenient to my business location.  The beds.  The bedrooms very dated the staff very good.  Could hear plumbing on occasion.  Great location.  I payed a lot for a very plane rooms.  I was there with my friends. No Negative.  great location U bahn S bahn museums parks grocery shopping street etc clean.  To many tables were dirty and not available the two times we visited Also conflicting information on price of buffet .  Available food was fine .  Breakfast was very weak As the hotel is close to the tube station it is easy to hear the trains If you get disturbed about that you better stay away from the basement .  Location cleanliness staff all were positive I have stayed at the basement but room was good Wi fi was decent even in my room I stayed only at nights so dont know daytime experience .  When I asked if I could still get the bus across the street to the airport it would have helped a lot if I was also told that the Malpensa bus was now on the other side of the station .  Love the breakfast also the happy hour Thanks again for the upgrade I love staying at your hotel .  Hot water problems .  Location hard to beat .  Cramped room with cheap old furniture bed Definitely not a superior room . No Positive.  Room was dark no view from window Noise outside from fan .  Good breakfast . No Negative.  Nice location but looking well used inside Anyway good value for money.  Needed some air conditioning Left the window open the entire 2 day stay .  Decent location and plenty of restaurants within walking distance .  Having fresh coffee at breakfast instead of machine.  The room was bright and spacious the bed was comfortable and large At breakfast there were lots of choices Hotel is near town centre Bus stop just outside the hotel and underground a bus stop away x.  No breakfast included even tho I paid over 230.  Staff absolutely amazing.  If I have to find a defect I must say the breakfast room is not so fascinating as the rest of the building that is an ancient restored palace .  The beds where really comfortable I liked the balcony with armchair and additional blanket for the chilly nights as well The shower was huge and with a big showerhead The coffee machine was a wonderful plus and then there was always a bottle of water Very useful and comfortable the super soft sponge bathrobe and the sponge slippers The position of the hotel was really good right in front of Urquinaona metro just across the street and in 5 minutes walk you are in barrio gothic There are some nice touches arond the hotel like always a very good scent in the hall and some yummy candy jars around Forgot to tell when you check in they offer you some drinks The hotel bar has a nice outdoor area in a green courtyard Last but not least the reception staff was excellent . No Negative.  Lovely location very close to Paddington but quiet and safe bars and restaurants very close by lovely outdoor pub next door close to Little Venice nice room and facilities .  Took a little time to heat up the room.  The bed was lovely.  Nothing.  Staff were friendly Room was big and really comfy. No Negative.  Great stay at the holiday inn will def be back the receptionist Daphne was the most cheerful helpful receptionist ever she s very welcoming loved the hotel overall great location and easy to get to dam spuare on tram etc barman was a funny wee man too great craic .  Got very little sleep the first night because of noise in next room from 2 am onwards Rang reception to complain . No Positive.  The rooms were a bit smaller than I expected .  The pool was lovely and warm It s not huge but big enough to have a swim about .  I do not believe I got the best out of the money Suite was overrated .  Staff was very welcoming and polite Excellent room service and hotel products smells like haven The hotel is a 15 20 min walk away from all luxury shopping and central city and the staff is more then happy too help you find your way . No Negative.  Everything .  soundproofing in my room.  nice design location is perfect hotel is new. No Negative.  Amazing location quirky room amazing bathroom well thought out room and facilities quick room service friendly and not pretentious The most comfortable bed and pillows .  Details such as no conditioner and no spare toothbrush in bathrooms not good Also the coffee at the breakfast room is awful for the price I would recommend the hotel invest in coffee which does not taste and smell like rancid Nescaf .  Location and bed comfort were commendable atmosphere is also very relaxed which is good of course .  Staff difficult to understand.  Room was lovely nice view of the city location fabulous .  Small room.  Clean room good value.  Breakfast seemed very expensive nearly 50 for two people so we didn t bother walked down the road and found a nice cafe instead Otherwise really couldn t fault this hotel .  The room was clean and comfortable with a massive bed It was my boyfriends birthday and when we went out to explore we returned to find a birthday cake which had been left for him which was a really nice gesture Hotel is in a great central location but also very quiet just a short walk to major tourist sights and the tube .  We had left a parcel and when we rang up about it We was fob off and told to call back and talk to housekeeper Not what we expected from the Hilton.  We liked the staff some where vary helpful others not.  N A.  Excellent stay Thank you .  The room was tiny for what we paid .  The location was good and the staff were very helpful .  Bigger room I got one of the small ones .  The staff was extraordinary .  Nothing.  Room interior was great Roof top terrace Staff very accommodating. No Negative.  Beautiful hotel nice caf and bar downstairs great gourmet breakfast The location is perfect especially if you re only spending a short time in Barcelona and don t really want to spend time traveling around The staff are extremely nice and forthcoming with assistance The food and drink options in the hotel are very unique and add to the experience not your usual boring hotel fare The bed is very comfortable The room is small but well planned out with nothing missing or inconvenient All in all a great choice at a reasonable price .  roomspace.  location.  For the amount of money we paid for one night for five people the rooms were very ordinary Our rooms were very pokey on different floors and very hot with only tiny little windows looking out on to scaffolding It would be nice to have a top sheet on the bed as it gets very hot with a doona but is nice to have a cover .  The best feature of this hotel is its location We were only back in London for one night having stayed earlier in the month in an apartment Given the cost of other similarly located hotels in London the price is ok but it is exorbitant compared to apartments It is very easy to access Covent Garden tube and catch the Picadilly line straight out to Heathrow so it is worth staying here for the convenience of access Rooms are clean Breakfast is what you expect in a large hotel buffet style and good to be included in the price .  Rooms were very warm and with the aircon turn on it was very dry Just wish I could open a window 1 small beer and a coke was 14 euros .  Location is great. No Negative.  What we loved about this cozy hotel The excellent location Latin Quarter close to the restaurants public transportation stores etc Coffee Nespresso and macaroons all day and delicious pastry and champagne from 5pm Great staff very helpful and polite . No Negative.  The staff were a little late with our room so we got an up grade The reception man Ross was so helpful and kept us informed .  Staff.  Normal. No Negative.  Great room clean.  A bit inconvenient location for public traffic options no internet.  Great room and staff awesome value for money. No Negative.  The location Breakfast Room styling Easy check in.  The room I stayed in was very small and was shabbier than the rest of the hotel .  The hotel lounges bar and restaurant are all very charming and it s so well situated between Marylebone and Oxford Street . No Negative.  The staff is extremely knowledgeable friendly and efficient The breakfast was delicious and the all day availability of snacks and beverages is a plus The location is perfect . No Negative.  Central location Typical business hotel with a room larger than I expected.  Some of the areas where a little tatty but there was work being done to improve the Hotel .  The breakfast was good and the rooms were clean and comfortable .  Poor decoration sad room uncomfy pillows bad smell of the sheets towels.  Nothing special.  Was stunned to learn that you had to pay extra for Wifi in the room Was not what I was expecting for a 5 star service Especially after paying so much for the room Most 3 and 4 star hotels offer free wifi these days We decided also that 40 per person for breakfast was also not value for money In Passeig de Gracia there are loads of Cafes that provide quality foods for much less than this .  The staff are very friendly the location is excellent and the design of the hotel is great The room is an excellent size and the bed is very comfortable We had a lovely meal in the Moments restaurant Well worth a visit and the price I highly recommend taking the Trip . No Negative.  Location and price was excellent. No Negative.  The room was amazing with perfect views We had breakfast in our room rather than joining the masses and it was just so good The hotel was very quiet throughout the night no noisy neighbours or street parties .  The bed could do with a better mattress .  Staff were very good and the breakfast was lovely the room was really nice let down a bit by the bed .  Breakfast service was just satisfactory Tables need to be cleared whilst you are still sitting there and getting more to eat as the tables are small and have no extra room for finished dishes .  Position was great to walk to most tourist attractions or bus or underground Covent Gardens market behind hotel Also very close to West End Theatres . No Negative.  super location at plaza espana can reach all important spots very fast room very nice clean and super service .  Shower was difficult to get into once in no problem No bedside table due to a very small room .  Comfy beds good checking in and out Good internet access . No Negative.  The club room is too small only 2 tables The snacks is pathetic and the breakfast is poor value .  Nothing .  Deluxe upgrade to a beautiful room in fantastic location and complimentary treats superb.  Nothing .  The bed pillows and duvet were very comfortable The staff were lovely Location was excellent . No Negative.  Very friendly and helpfull staff marvelous rooms with super comfy beds and a breakfast no no the breakfast you ve got to check out yourself By the way it s a real challenge to find anything negative about this Hotel . No Negative.  I stayed at The Bryson Hotel for one night with my boyfriend and we enjoyed our stay very much We wanted to do some sightseeing and shopping in London and the Location of this brand new hotel was brilliant There are 2 underground stations with main lines and also buses to the city centre every 5 minutes and it only takes another 10min to be in Oxford Circus The British and Dickens Museum Covent Garden Leicester Square Piccadilly Old Street Liverpool street I was amazed how close everything was The Hotel was lovely it is a Brand New one and everything looks so clean tidy and fresh Our bathroom was big and spacious The bed very comfortable and the toiletries very nice Staff was very helpful I do hope we can go back soon .  Bit of stale smoke smell in room .  Nice pool and deck with lovely greenery Nice wooden floors in rooms Friendly staff Great value . No Negative.  Superb hotel understated by its four star rating It had everything including good shopping centre and restaurants virtually on site .  Breakfast expense.  Interiors location. No Negative.  Excellent and helpful staff .  The extra charges for indoor Pool.  Rooftop bar .  Our greeting on arrival bordered on rude and not welcoming at all We hadn t realised until the night before we checked out that guests are normally given a tour on arrival so we were unaware of the lovely sitting room with wines drinks etc We enjoyed it on the last night of 5 nights thanks to the very helpful staff working that night .  Location excellent to underground Westend show and to get around London Great cafes close by for breakfast Rooms quaint authentic In general most staff were nice The lady who went out of her way to look up overland train schedule for us represented Hazlitts beautifully .  Beds could be more comfortable Find it peculiar that a choice of whether to have breakfast from one day where it costs 19 to the following day where it costs 28 No mention of wifi whether it was free or not and how to access it Building is dated from the outside with a modern interior .  Location is ideal for visiting the Westfield Shopping Centre or Kensington itself. No Negative.  This place is amazing So relaxing and homely yet luxurious Would recommend in a heartbeat . No Negative.  The Staff was really helpful The Room was spotless . No Negative.  bed was good and right size i am a 6 2 feet tall though the room was small but it was perfect for 2 people so they gave 2 rooms for family of 4 . No Negative.  rooms really nice. No Negative.  Like it all and London brasserie breakfasts great. No Negative.  Excellent and very helpful staff at the front desk.  Rooms are a little on the small side especially with a baby.  The hotel was of very good standard and the staff are very pleasant.  The two way glass into the ensuite from the bedroom took some getting used to until it steamed up.  We were luky enough to have an Emporer suite as we were upgraded super views and excellent room Valet parking useful but should be advertised as access is difficult.  We reserved 1 room for 3 person but there was no sofa bed for our son only a sofa Bath tub was rusty in a 4 star hotel .  Excellent location nice building very helpful staff. No Negative.  Bed was comfy Bed needs stoppers to stop rolling away.  Shower bath was bit old but works .  Location was convenient from Train station Room and bed were very comfortable . No Negative.  Bed not very comfy.  No hot water for a shower on the last day .  The breakfasts were fab .  Bed mattress uncomfortable Room was too hot .  Location close to central station and yelliw green subway lines.  Checking in just us took an age Working the air conditioning panel was not intuitive you need to use your finger nail it s not touch screen The breakfast buffet although the choice and taste was great each day everything was cold and it didn t matter whether you cane down at 08 00 or 10 00 There was a big queue for breakfast most days too 20 min wait is totally unacceptable 5 mins isn t acceptable in my book .  Hotel Staff were friendly and helpful Once you figured out the metro and trams location was good Breakfast buffet selection was very good . No Negative.  Location.  nothing to complain.  Location and hotel service .  Small room.  Very nice staff.  Room very small Had requested prior to arrival that extra sheets be placed under the duvets Not there on arrival Informed reception who promised they would be put on beds whilst we were out but still not there when we returned Asked at reception again and then had TWO different people bring sheets Then had to make up the beds ourselves Better communication between department would have prevented this inconvenience Also a ridiculous arrangement for buying breakfast which incidentally we d experience on two previous visits On first morning were told we had to purchase vouchers for 12 each at reception were told by restaurant staff that if we paid in the restaurant the price would be 13 Next morning we were told they had no more vouchers and had changed the system so that we had to sign for breakfast in the restaurant which we duly did the cost 12 not 13 Most confusing Hopefully they have changed the system so that you simply sign for breakfast Of course what would be even better would be to include breakfast in the room rate it is quite expensive .  Excellent location comfy beds mostly charming staff .  Our orginal room.  Our original room deluxe suite was dissapointing dated and shabby However we were given a free upgrade to a club which was very nice of them to do and this room although a little dated was far better and what we expected .  Nothing.  The hotel does justice to this iconic building Straight off the train and straight into your holiday or break Ideal location for London and the sights . No Negative.  Extremely Friendly staff and spacious room Right next to the metro station . No Negative.  Location.  The room stank of damp and was tiny compared to pictures Carpet in corridor was dirty .  Staff were nice and helpful.  We ourder from the hotel to clean up our room they sayed will change us That was surprising me .  The great welcoming the man who helps us was so nice He offered us up grade for our reservation to got a better deals The service secure clean were gret .  None.  All staffs were pretty cooperative.  No lift.  Location and friendly staff . No Negative.  Excellent location.  The room was quite small but nice The concierge was not informed about vital information important to travelers We were taking a day trip to Versailles and inquired where to catch the train We had tickets for a tour so our time was limited when we got to the recommended train station it was closed for construction as was the entire train line We stopped a Taxi and asked where to catch a train but he didn t know so we paid him to drive us to Versailles So disappointing and when we told the concierge she was surprised but didn t offer to do anything for us . No Positive.  Breakfast is a bit chaotic and it is strange for the continuous queues soundproof is a problem .  Tube station Warren Street is just next store very convenient bed is comfortable Heating system works well staff is polite and friendly.  More packs of coffee tea packs should placed in rooms for making coffe tea in the room .  Eggs were were coocked properly beds were vvvvv comfortable no discomfort was felt whole night we took a very deep sleep.  Shower wasn t the most powerful.  Location very friendly helpful courteous staff Our room was not ready on arrival as something had to be fixed by maintenance so we were given free champagne in the hotel bar our bags were waiting for us in the room once ready and cakes and pastries were delivered as an apology.  I loved everything about it Nothing to dislike Just one tiny thing is that you can hear doors closing and people who walk heavily in the corridor .  The staff was outstanding They accommodated my needs even when I was not feeling well The receptionists from checking in and checking out were completely outstanding even had a free upgrade room upon check in and brilliant shower with great hot water important to me Glad they understood my English as I don t speak French Keep up the good work and do not lose that special touch you give your guests . No Negative.  The staff was extra helpfull They almost assisted us in every aspect They proposed the best restaurants and made all reservations Guided us on places to visit. No Negative.  We had a comfortable stay The room was well equipped and clean Breakfast was wonderful . No Negative.  Friendly staff great location clean room. No Negative.  Clean comfortable in a great position for visiting the sights.  The rooms are small but normal for the area and I could hear someone snoring in the next room It s an old building which is charming but I like modern hotels.  Perfect location Helpful and friends staff Warm welcome and they brought us tea making facilities on request . No Negative.  Close to bcn Sants if you have to take a train or ave to anywhere in Spain .  a bit away from tram station.  size of the room and bed reasonable parking fee .  Only 1 lift.  Staff were really friendly and helpful excellent location. No Negative.  The property was almost fairytale like It was just a sublimely beautiful hotel with the most amazing views of Paris .  My room had a bad odour oozing from the drain and next thing a TV was removed from the suite We were left bare overnight without a TV .  Friendly staff and location.  Breakfast and drinks expensive.  Location to tube views .  Run down No heating in room En suite smelled and extractor not working Maintenance guy only free after 4 hours Changed rooms and slightly better Probably living off the 5 Cavendish Hotel name .  Location central London.  It was very over heated I had to go for a walk to regain normal temperature .  The single room could accommodate two so although small it was well appointed The staff were quick to respond and helpful It was most helpful to be able to leave luggage before checking in time .  Nothing adverse.  Location ambience decor.  A corporate hotel at the corporate end of Chiswick The kind you find anywhere in the World For the Chiswick village touch stay closer to the center .  very quite large room rear good wifi .  Somewhat remote location but trams nearby Front desk needs training Once the staff learns you are staying in house the attitude improves .  Several fine restaurants Great staff Pricey To really be what they should be the general staff needs to rise a few levels and emulate the restaurants So this is several fine restaurants with a hotel not the reverse . No Negative.  Lovely hotel Not fussy Easy to find Great pool area and lovely staff.  We arrived by car and it can be a bit troublesome to unload and load there is limited space in front of the hotel .  We received a great welcome from the staff and their attitude was consistently friendly throughout the stay Comfortable room with a good large bed and a spacious shower Nice area it is some distance from the centre but we had no trouble reaching it on foot and taxi and the bill was reasonable We had a small balcony with a very nice view of the Av Diagonal Pleasant breakfasts on the rooftop terrace with a choice of seating in the sun and the shade Good restaurants bars and shopping nearby .  Breakfast.  Comfort and quite room as decribed .  We just wished the breakfast was included in the price.  The staff were extremely friendly The hotel is located on a lovely and safe street in the centre of Paris .  Breakfast is best enjoyed early The food is good and freshly cooked the staff work very hard and keep the standard high But the restaurant used is tight for the number of breakfasters After 7 30 queues can build up both for entry and at the buffets which can make you feel a bit crushed and rushed .  I visited for a conference and trade show with towards 700 attendees Facilities were excellent both for lectures and for the exhibition As a hotel it was more expensive than my usual budget but it is easy to see why the price is justified and I feel I got good value for money Staff were always smiling never intrusive but available for the slightest thing the secret of success The food was the high point for me There are several contrasting options I tried Edg and Fiamma Relaxed but efficient service at table good menu choices Food was perfectly cooked and well presented special thanks to Guiseppe and crew The after dinner cocktails are intriguing and well worth sampling .  Unwelcoming reception room smell disgusting the layout was horrendous and cheap Wardrobe inside the toilet area Tv on the side wall After complains regarding the smell which they agreed it was very bad they decided to move us but to a cheaper room So we didnt get what we paid for Toiletries are extremely basic The spa is so small is suffocating Overall a horrendous experience all over Won t be returning not sure how did they get a 5 star rating Next time back will stick to the Langham.  The bar hot stone massage was superb.  Price for breakfast exaggerated.  Location room size of double bed.  We had a quiet room facing back but needed an eye mask as security lights on all night outside .  Great location for Olympia and really nice room for 3 Clean and comfortable with nice touches like the kitchenette with fridge .  little noisy at night from room above different ambience but we think we would enjoy the hotel more on a return visit.  Location staff food cleanliness decor.  Price of restaurant Very tight with coffee at breakfast. No Positive. No Negative.  Excellent location for O2 arena with superb friendly service and great fresh breakfast providing a range of choices to eat .  The hotel is very dated The whole hotel is dirty the rooms are gloomy we had to move room once as the first room smelt really bad The second room was not much better but we just had to get on with it as they would not refund us our money so we could go somewhere else The staff are rude and not bothered in customer service The breakfast is 16 for dry bacon and dry beans I would never stay here again and don t recommend anyone too There are much cheaper better hotels Wish I would of read the review first I am not a person to complain about silly things but this really is a joke .  There was nothing at all what i liked about this hotel. No Negative.  Staff are really kind . No Negative.  Loved it. No Negative.  Everything. No Negative.  As a hotel managed by Hilton Brand it has adecent services and nice facilities On the very first day of arrival the stuff at reception encouraged to give fedback if there was any complain The location of the hotel is convenient taking more or less 20 mins to get downtown In all I personally recommand this hotel if you want a sound sleep and cheersome breakfast . No Negative.  Perfect location for our needs.  the price is high.  location is perfect so clean.  The hotel is split over 2 separate buildings on either side of the road which wasn t clear when booking so you could end up in either one .  Nice friendly and pleasant staff Rooms were clean well looked after and well finished.  Breakfast was very expensive for what was on offer .  Excellent location for the Eiffel Tower and the Champs de Mar train station Room was very nice and comfortable .  They advertise free wifi but at check in I received a free wifi voucher which was valid for 5 days only and we had booked and stayed 6 nights They would have probably provided an extra voucher if I asked but it is a bit shortsighted on their part When booking we asked for a room above the street ground level but the room allocated to us was in fact on ground level and facing the back yard Although this was a slight disappointment the silver lining was that the room had a private veranda with a bench and a table and my wife and I actually spent many quiet moments there reminiscing on the day s sights and activities In the time we spent there we had breakfast only once as we mostly ate on foot through out town I felt that the options and food selections are slightly scanty and minimalistic but this seems normal for most small hotels and establishments I did not leave hungry though The complimentary coffee and tea in our room were not replenished daily which is a bit of a surprise because the way I see it if lodgers change daily the staff would have to refill these for the new guests Because of this and the wifi issue mentioned earlier and considering the price range of this hotel I could not help getting a tiny feeling of stinginess and parsimoniousness on part of the staff management but this is just a minor feeling perhaps not even worth writing about .  The location is beautiful The entire area is surrounded by museums Both Hyde Park and the Royal Albert Hall are 2 3 minutes away just up the street The hotel is clean and the staff are helpful and very friendly Because the hotel is pretty small nestled in an old London house this makes it very quiet with a strong feeling of privacy compared to larger hotels Nothing in particular stands out to be praised The rooms are what one would expect Bedding is clean and soft the beds are comfortable . No Negative.  Lovely and comfortable room great choice for breakfast Great location for a London break .  The inside of the rooms didn t match how nice outside and the hallways were.  The location. No Negative.  Service and Staff was excellent The fourth time that I stay in the Hotel in four years and was treated like a well known customer . No Negative.  And there is super hot barman .  Wifi must be free unacceptable to pay loads of euro per day in 2016 Facilities are very old it s a jump in the 80s Value for money not there at all.  Good location good staff .  Rooms are perfect for a solo traveller or couple but would maybe lack intimacy for friends travelling together.  My favourite hotel in London The rooms are small but so beautifully designed and functional that you don t want to leave Very good location also behind the Tate Modern.  Quite impersonel long reaction time of the staff when an issue is reported no TV available one of the nights I spent there .  The view and location .  Very poor air con and very greasy breakfast on 2 nd day.  Rooms were small air con was awful and renovations could be managed better 1 staff lift is not sufficient for guest numbers Great location the standard of breakfast varied from very good to very poor this seemed to be when different kitchen staff were on .  Small room.  Location.  When I arrived late in the evening they just told me they had given away the room put me into a taxi and sent me to another bad hotel in another part of town where I did not want to be but only after they forced me to pay the invoice for the room which I never saw which I had to accept because I did not have anywhere else to go They had my phone number and e mail so they could have asked me at any time if I were going to show up which by the way I always did every single time I booked there since I have an important client just mext door but they did not After very little sleep I had to get up earlier the next day and take a taxi which I obviously had to pay for myself to reach my client where I spent the rest of the day fighting against headaches and exhaustion courtesy of this appalling establishment .  Nothing.  No allocated smoking area in premises.  Service and staff.  The staff attitude is rude and they treat guests as if they are staying for free not paying money a terrible experience really.  Nothing. No Negative.  Location service room bed Very close to good restaurants and easy access to Hyde Park. No Negative.  Great location and fantastic staff.  Air con in room was either freezing or hot don t think the thermostat worked sheets on bed were poorly fitted otherwise very good.  Great staff lovely rooms and a good continental breakfast.  Just one point the room was on the ground floor bedroom window overlooked small patio and a back gate The window needed to be open for air as it was a hot evening but I felt insecure when sleeping as there was no stay on the window to stop an outsider opening the window and coming into the room .  Crisp clean sheets large bath sheet comfortable chair to sit on comfrotable bed. No Negative.  I thought the room was excellent and te customer service we received from staff was outstanding I would definitely return again.  Basement room with window facing the pavement room very small not as impressive as it looks on the web site.  Great location in general clean environment.  Breakfast.  Everything.  I was told the taxi to the airport from the hotel would charge me 95 euros at the reception but the taxi arranged by the hotel ended up taking 115 euros Not very good communication there Reception staff a little unfriendly in general .  Everything else was great No complaints .  Iron room no irons in rooms .  Staff.  Not the cleanest room I have ever been in but a long way from the worst Bedside power fitting was broken and looked like it had been that way for some time Stuffy room with no possibility to open a window The aircon was OK but was set to a standard temperature with only two degrees of variability either side permitted on the controls If you like to sleep with ambient fresh air in the room as I do then you may find this annoying It gave me a headache .  Easy to find and drive to and easy to park Very helpful and cheerful staff The pool and 24 7 fitness centre looked amazing but I had no time to do anything other than admire them sadly .  Decoration and breakfast were average Feels like an upmarket travel lodge .  Location wasn t too bad Clean Quiet rooms Friendly staff good wifi . No Negative.  That is a very good and comfortable eco friendly hotel for families with kids There are a lot and secure place for kids to play Even the floor was warm and clean all over the lobby so kids was running with socks only The restorant is very good also Everybody was very friendly Thank you .

Location superb great base for shopping shows londons tourist sights Liked having water machine bottles on the corridor Coffee facilities were good downstairs. No Negative.  Friendly staff nespresso machine.  The rooms were smaller than we hoped .  The staff were helpful and attentive to our needs The location is great for a night or two in London .  The only downside was that the bed for some weird reason wasn t that comfortable and I didn t really sleep well throughout the night I do allow it the doubt of me being here for only one night and for a single visit so I assume it was either me or a case in which they d love to switch my room had I given them the chance.  The staff are extremely friendly and welcoming It looks great in a well designed historic building.  We had a bit of a frosty reception by one lady receptionist but other than that our stay was delightul We normally stay at t select hotel in the Latin quarter which we love and it s a little closer to the Latin quatre .  The pillows were amazingly soft our bed was a super King and very comfty indeed The reception men were very delightful and attentive we asked for an ice bucket two nights in a row to cool our champagne we had bought in t Latin quarter and got it strait away Fresh fruit was on offer each morning free of charge by the reception desk The rooms are lovely and clean as is all of the hotel We stayed with our 5year old son and we felt very safe and comfortable in the hotel atmosphere we would stay here again .  the price it is very expensive.

Good location pleasant bar and excellent breakfast Staff very helpful they went the extra mile .  the bedrooms were a bit tatty Old fashioned Dusty bedroom and air con didn t work .  The location was great for walking into the centre of the city Nearby restaurants and a good bar on the square Close to attractions.  nothing.  hotel was very clean and staff very friendly and gave us a late check out as flight in evening the room was a little more expensive than other hotels but well worth it . No Negative.  The staff were really wonderful and accommodating I can t wait to go back .  Had to ask for kettle tea and coffee Not provided as standard in the room .  Rooms were large and the bathroom facilities excellent .  None.  Close to railway station tube It provides very good varieties for breakfast A good four stars hotel.  It was just as it should be and better .  Deliciously quirky and decorated with magnificent decadence Refreshingly friendly staff sublime cocktails and a wonderfully comfortable bed in a hushed room .  Check in staff appallingly rude Customer service very poor Unless you have to be in Bermondsey location is poor .  Nothing. No Negative.  Gorgeous lobby.  Rooms are now in need of a makeover it still the same as 20 years ago but such a great location. No Positive.  Bedroom was quite small but was adequate. No Positive.  Staff don t appear to be trained and spent a lot of time waiting for our baggage from the storage.  Convenient for getting around London.  It s a very small thing but the coffee at breakfast was not the best This in no way spoilt out stay.  The room was spacious well equipped and ultra comfortable.  bad internet connection poor breakfast and poor service at breakfast.  Location Room.  150 deposit taken no previous mention of it until arrival staff didn t no what had happened on night shift to day shift.  The location and settings of the hotel was perfect the rooftop terrace gave beautiful views of the city. No Negative.  Good Will come again .  No obvious place to hang towels Couldn t get radio on tv Room was compact and bijou which might bother some people not us .  Great location Nicely furnished and presented room Complmentary refreshments Nice staff .  Breakfast way to expensive Bathroom smelled like vinegar and shower toilet leaked all over the floor The lowest quality hilton I have stayed at so far .  room was comfortable .  We should have stayed a bit longer .  The location is really good just a couple of streets back from the Champs Elysees just a couple of minutes walk The building is beautiful with extremely elegant decor filled with antiques and paintings It looked very freshly decorated The bedroom colour scheme was very stylish and quite modern with a small but beautiful ensuite bathroom The staff were very friendly and helpful without being intrusive We loved it We will definitely go back .  The room I stayed in was on the ground floor right next to the road which was quite noisy at night and woke me up a few times Consider asking for a room that is set back from the road for a better night s sleep .  Good location and reasonable price for central London .  There was nothing I didn t like.  It was a great. No Negative.  Nice hotel friendly staff good location. No Negative.  Very family friendly hotel Great location with many restaurants 2 minutes walk to subway Bercy .  .  Great location .

Lowered check in desk for shorter or disabled Jellybeans and Pringles missing Only one duck 2people Automatic doors for people with mobility issues and wheelchair users Didn t get the room I booked . No Positive.  The area around the hotel seemed very business y mostly hotels and there is the main train station Nevertheless it was a convenient location for us since we wanted to be close to the train station.  We chose this hotel because of its proximity to the train station it s a brisk 5 minute walk which allowed us to drop off our luggages and walk around freely The neighborhood itself is okay but there is a supermarket nearby although it closes really early and you can find places to shop within the train station Belvedere palace is within walking distance and you can take the U bahn easily from the train station to get to other parts of Vienna We really needed water one night but nothing was open but they had vending machines on every floor so crisis averted Breakfast was not included for us so we paid 15 euros each for two days of breakfast and it was well worth it Great selection of ham cheeses bread pastries and salads Overall very pleasant stay and the wifi was fast .  Nothing.  Location is excellent lots of restaurant and cafes during weekends you will find a big festival at the end of the street where you can feel the real Londoners life Rooms are large compared to London s Hotels Everything is nearby.  Nothing could have been better I m afraid .  Good enough Club is a real gem Definitely my favourite spot in London The Garden is extraordinary .  Nothing.  Everything was first class the service the rooms and the attention to detail.  Only point is that putting two twin beds together does not make a double bed .  Location was perfect very central most stuff walking distance Rooms very nice beds very comfortable Staff very nice and helpful .  Lot of noise outside from building work.  The friendly staff.  The shower and toilet sink can t get the water away when using them I need to wait for 10 minutes until all the water gets away .  The apartment is gorgeous Very clean with air conditioner good value with best experience staying here .  Could not get a cribb for my one year old even though I requested one in well advance Last min I am told that they dont have anythjng left Inam surprised to hear that from Hilton .  Excellent location Pleasent stay Had a great time during the stay .  I have seen better staff These guys weren t always helpful and not as welcoming The property is overrated for being a museum We expected more Rooms were extremely small and sometimes not as practical It was quite expensive compared to the other hotel and less value for money .  The location is fairly good with easy access to Placa Catalunya and the La Ramblas The breakfast was decent They had great showers .  Hotel and rooms look a little dated A C didn t work. No Positive.  Room was cold at first but heater kicked in on second day It was a very cold day so wasn t too surprised .  Great location comfortable and spacious rooms friendly staff and excellent breakfast Reception lounge small but pleasantly stylish for the price paid . No Negative.  The location is excellent and the room is spacious and has everything necessary for a good relax There are plenty of cafes fitting all tastes.  Ordered 2 meals in the bar the evening we arrived For the first time in my life I sent a meal back to the kitchen My friend struggled valiantly with her burger but was defeated Both meals despite appearing over cooked were actually cold The Fish and chips were inedible and when sent back to the kitchen they then reappeared having been microwaved disgusting Don t eat here go somewhere else.  Great location in a lovely street convenient for parks and museums. No Negative.  Staff were great Clean and comfy.  We booked a smoking room which they said was not available However housekeeping put a large ashtray so we checked if it was a smoking room They said no So why did they put it there Disappointing Lobby was not great TV channels not great .  The size of the room.  Hot water didn t work No plug in the bathroom to bath Bed very uncomfortable not great for 109 a night. No Positive.  an inappropiate guest party at the bar but the waitress moved us to another table to avoid any issue.  Great staff they upgraded our room in order to be in the same floor all family members Thanks Marc.  The nespresso machine and no kettle if you wanted tea Also the walk in pantry was poorly stocked.  The room decor. No Negative.  The design of the hotel is amazing the rooms are beautiful.  No spa no pool available Gym has to be paid extra .  Room comfort and design location wifi connection service and breakfast all this was very good .  We booked this hotel for the rooftop bar expecting a nice chilled drink looking over the Square We went up before going to bed only to be met with a private party in section of roof with a view then were sat in middle of roof with no view at all Drinks also seemed overly expensive which i wouldn t have minded had we had a decent view It all seemed very pretentious and not what we expected at all .  Reception staff really helpful Great location .  no tea and coffee facilities in the room this should be provided as a minimum loud club noise on the Saturday night which went on until about 3 4 in the morning.  Staff were super friendly and helpful faultless pool and bar area were really great.  old. No Positive. No Negative.  The Staff where very helpful and friendly .  The fact you couldn t actually get out of the building without your key card annoying if it didn t work and kept having to go back to reception .  Bed very comfy no complaints Excellent position and cheap parking .  Not enough storage for clothes if you like to unpack everything whilst you are there If you leave most of your clothes in the suitcase it s not a problem at all .  The rooms were lovely only problem was there wasn t a great deal of storage space for your clothes Other than that we stayed in a superior room the bed vas very comfortable the room was clean The staff were very friendly and helpful Good value for money too Would recommend staying here Good central location too 20 min taxi ride from the airport 5 min walk into the centre of Vienna .  That they don t have transportation from the hotel to the city.  The pool area and the service.  the entrance to the hotel was a bit dark but the warm reception people were great the outside of the hotel didn t look like a hotel we could have missed it so i think the external presentation should be improved.  position of hotel it was modern and a bit quirky which we loved lovely room great shower plenty of hanging space plug sockets .  The hotel as wooden floor boards the noise from the other rooms carry The room i stayed in was a bit little very cramped .  location is great .  Bit pricey.  Very helpful staff and clean hotel and good location. No Negative.  Smart well presented hotel easy to get too with very friendly and helpful staff The rooms are excellent with all the amenities you expect of a modern hotel Overall a very pleasurable experience .  It was all perfect I can t complain about a single thing .  Serious luxury we were attended to as though we were royalty The room was massive and had turn down service nightly We had access to a happy hour in the club lounge and a beautiful breakfast was included each morning The spa and gym were top notch and the staff was extra sweet to my 9 yo son It s also an AWESOME location tucked into a quiet residential street but only a two minute walk to trains buses and bustling Oxford St We LOVE this place We will be back .  Bed was terrible as was the size of the room Room was like being in a Travel Lodge with cheap furniture and dreadful small towels in the bathroom Bathrobes were riddled with holes Room 705 706 were the same and have no view whatsoever Stained carpets Guests have to pay for WiFi in the rooms but anyone can access from the lounge restaurant Money clearly spent elsewhere in this hotel .  Liked the lobby lounge and restaurant Staff very pleasant .  The wifi is a little poor depending upon the location of your room the toilet cleaning leaves a lot to be desired and the room maids do not comprehend the DO NOT DISTURB signs as they knock on the door and enter when the sign clearly says DO NOT DISTURB.  Great location staff are friendly and helpful. No Negative.  Fantastic breakfast buffet friendly staff and good location .  Rooms are very small Beds are cramped between 2 Walls You can t walk around the bed .  Nice decorations and good location .

No Negative.  I have stayed here several times It is both a nice facility and a great value The rooms are modern and functional which is the style that I prefer I love the showers which have the option of hand held or rain The breakfast buffets have a wide variety and they will prepare eggs on a custom basis The restaurant menu at other meals is somewhat limited but very good The location is perhaps a 20 minute walk from Las Ramblas and this is also my preference .  Nothing all good .  The staff was amazingly friendly and helpful It was a great location and our room was wonderful The breakfast buffet was delicious We hope to come back some day . No Negative.  Great location .  An incense type of smell in the room also a little overpriced but it is London after all .  Very comfortable stay good room service and attentive staff .  OUR BATHROOM WAS HORRID AND SCRUFFY BITS MISSING OFF THE TAP WINDOW COVERED IN BLACK MILDEW CRACKED TILES AND MILDEW AROUND BTH i DID point this out to staff they offered to move us but having had breast surgery the week before the thought of moving was too much The mirror from the tipup dressing table was missing the curtains which were new had not been hung properly and husband did the needful there Just overall needing a good spring clean from net curtains in windows to carpets All in all we were both very disappointed We returned to our room at 13 30 and it had not been freshened up or beds made I did complain about that and it was rectified pretty quickly When we returned to our room at 2300 hours on Tuesday night a bottle of wine and some strawberries had been left with an apology but we returned the wine as were flying home and neither could we drink it late or carry it I am not normally a complainer but I felt had visitors from abroad come to this room they would have left this island with a pretty poor view .  Location and breakfast both good.  Hotel a little tired in need of updating our bathroom clean but old Breakfast very average and busy .

Room size was very good .  decor of rooms was a bit tired.  nice comfy beds.  Room was an attic room with very little head room ended up sleeping the other end of bed due to the roof been so close to our heads Breakfast wasn t great not a great choose and disappointed it was more continental No hot food.  Staff were very friendly and room was clean Location was close to lot of attractions.  Almost everything was broken from the heating to the window .  Good location.  You have to pay for SPA access which is ridiculous and a very cheap move for a five star hotel Housekeeping will call the room every morning to ask you if you want the room to be done when a sign DND was clearly put on the door very and extremely rude strategy .  Reception and concierge very helpful cozy lobby great location .  The sircinditioning was not Effective in our room.  roof top bar and great breakfast. No Negative.

The bathroom was well appointed and had radiant heat behind the mirrors so they didn t fog up The staff was super helpful .  The music in the lobby and canteen was to loud during breakfast In the evening it was even worse It s a pity because lobby and canteen were spacious and beautiful .

We had a lovely room on the 5th floor with a balcony and quite a nice view The bed was extremely comfortable The whole place was clean and designed in a very stylish way There were only nice people that we got in touch with especially at the reception I would definitely recommend it .  Wasn t put into quiet area although had requested Check in took a long time Didn t have a vanity mirror or dressing table in the room so a bit of manoeuvring was required to get ready to go out Put in back of hotel overlooking car park .

Location is super convenient There s a city sightseeing bus stop near hotel At the day that I checked in I caught a cold normally the hotel has a limit check in time I thought about ask the staff to let me check in early But I didn t say anything yet I got my key card This hotel is amazing I ll live here again next time .  Nothing really .  Very friendly and helpful staff Comfortable room and great location .  When we arrived at hotel the bathroom was dirty it looked like there was excrement on the floor I didn t examine closely enough to be sure 100 When we complained to front desk instead of being apologetic they seemed to be insulted by our complaint and had the audacity to say that it couldn t have been there when we got the room and it must have been us Their attitude totally wound my wife and I up and it put a proper dampener on our weekend away .

Model of the Eiffel Tower in the couryard had lights which flashed all night However staff noted our commment and promised to deal with it .  Room overlooked a pleasant courtyard and was surprisingly quiet .  Possibly to have air conditioning in the rooms and the front breakfast room .  We loved staying here It was our first time in London The rooms were spotless and the area was delightful as the tube was only just around the corner along with shops eateries and restaurants It was a great place to stay All the staff were extremely accommodating and the continental breakfast was fantastic .

Everything was really good The bathroom really nice Bed very comfortable Room service And afternoon tea were perfect Great location And professional service 10 10.  Lack of Tea milk in room .  Location.  The bed was a bit too hard for me I think there was perfume in the air conditioning or used in the room cleaning I have perfume allergy and I did not like the perfume smell in the bedroom But I was able to open the window so that helped The dining room did not open until 7 30pm so I had to wait from 6pm and I was hungry The food prices are not cheap but its similar to other hotels much cheaper to eat outside the hotel.  It was raining on my arrival A staff member came out with an umbrella as I was getting out of the taxi and took my bags The reception staff were courteous and helpful The double room was pleasant and had everything I needed I got a wake up call on request I got late check out at 6pm for a cost of 50 euros .  Breakfast wasn t the best or the service but would still go back again but on a bed only basis next time .  Great location and a good Hotel. No Negative.  The staff and location.  Lack of additional facilities e g gym and if being pedantic the rooms are perhaps slightly utilitarian However overall it is excellent value for money and very comfortable .

No Negative.  N ra till shopping .  Slow wifi Guests have to pay extra to use a fast one TV had problems and couldn t be used when it was needed .  Clean and neat room Staff very polite and friendly .  nothing.  great place and location nice and quiet yet in bustling center city staff great. No Negative.  The staff were very helpful and the hotel was very clean and lovely food.  I felt the bedroom and especially the bathroom were very claustrophobic The room consequently was over warm and I found it difficult to sleep .  Attractive lobby and breakfast room The food offered was very good .  When we arrived our room has been cancelled So the receptionist told us only 1 room available in the hotel due to a lot going on in London that weekend We asked the price it was 230 an extra 120 than we have originally paid We had to pay the difference otherwise we would have been stranded in London for the night When we paid and went to our new room we were shocked and horrified to see the last guests belongings still all over the floor nothing had been cleaned house keeping hadn t even been in the room So I went straight to reception and they told us to use a different room even though they told us the dirty room was the only one in the hotel We got lied to There was no apology for the mix up nothing the guy just gave us the room key and said come down for breakfast in the morning on us No emotion nothing Good job they gave us free breakfast we were skint as the additional cost for the room was all we had saved to spend over our weekend in London So even the night we had planned for our anniversary was ruined instead of lovely romantic meal we had to settle for a bottle or water and a cheap take out pizza near by to our hotel So upset and angry at the situation .  Nothing .  Room wasn t fully cleaned prior to our stay Hotel was having work done which we weren t informed about prior to our visit Didn t replenish our tea and coffee in the room even after we asked . No Positive.  Multiple issues two examples 1 The lock on the door did not work so I had to push the bed up against the door in the night whilst I slept on it to make sure no one came in 2 On the Saturday afternoon I was there I came back in the middle of the day to be told I was not allowed in my room because members of staff were moving 3 large pieces of furniture through my room out into the garden my room had a door into the garden without gaining permission asking me if it was OK or even telling me this was going to happen When I asked if they could stop and carry out the moving of the furniture on Sunday morning after I had vacated the room because I was in a rush they refused and said they would only be a few more minutes another 15 minutes past They left my room full of dirty foot prints on the floor and had moved many of my personal items to get out of the other door .  Sadly not one aspect of the hotel was even up to a satisfactory standard . No Negative.  Have been to London many many times and been to many hotels I honestly am in love with this one The whole experience from the entrance and the greeting to the friendly and welcoming receptionist clean and cozy room and a very nice bar The rooms were quiet with a nice view Coming from Switzerland I always have a problem with the charger but not this time they had usb ports on the wall The position of the hotel is just above Oxford Circus which is good for those who want to go shopping or visit attractions or just go around The lobby is also amazing I will be using this hotel for my future visits to London I finally found the perfect location and service in London .

There were a lot of stains on the sofa.  The bed was really comfortable.  I thought the croissants were very dry I would have liked a kettle in the room .  The staff went the extra mile and treated us so well even though we had checked out and were waiting for onward travel It made all the difference to the end of the trip which can often be very anti climactic The room was lovely and the en suite was very clean and spacious Will be very happy to recommend the hotel to others .

Didn t like the bathroom it was made of glass so you could see the person using the toilet On checkin reception asked us if we wanted to have our towels changed every day or if we would make do with the one set they gave us to be eco friendly Also we agreed to donate 3 euro to some charity instead of having our room serviced every day We were told that at any time we could have fresh towels just ask anyone at reception This was not the case at all We were there for 4 nights and never had our room serviced at all We got no towels changed no toilet paper no bins emptied The room was a mess as there s nowhere to put anything no shelves in bathroom for ur towels so we had to leave them on bedroom floor We twice asked at reception for our room to be serviced but they didn t do it When we were leaving we complained to them about this and they did nothing We were disgusted I would never stay here again The reception staff don t seem to communicate with the rest of the staff and no matter what we asked them they didn t know They look confused all the time Also the breakfast was very limited which is not how the hotel sells themselves Our room was outside the hotel in another building which was a annoying as it was raining every day and we had to wear our coats to breakfast every morning Another thing they don t tell you .  The beds .  Would have expected a touch more luxury in the rooms for the price Shower hard to control and poor flow mouldy silicone sealant cracked tiles Not really worth the extra money back to premier inn in future .

The hotel old and not value the money it is very strange to be 4 star hotel.  Disappointed there was no bath in the room Gym It was a disgrace to even call it that it had a rower bike and cross trainer and no treadmill Very poor I just don t think that the hotel represented value for money We paid 375 euros for 2 nights Monday Tuesday with no breakfast included I expected more from the hotel in terms of fitness facilities and the size of the room and to have a bath included Had the room been significantly cheaper then I wouldn t have been as harsh in my critique .

The hotel is easy to miss as you walk on the street so keep eye out The rooms are very compact and there is not real privacy when you are in the bathroom as there is not a locking door between the room and bathroom We also noticed our carpets were not vacummed in the room .  The staff were friendly and the hotel was opposite one of the main train stations It is quite easy to get metros and there are lots of bakeries and eateries nearby .  The Eastern European receptionist was very rude.  Nice shower.  The aircon turned itself off after a while a few times and just had to flick it back on again .

All fine.  Location was quite far off from Paddington station The map indicated where the main lobby is but the room was in another building a few blocks away .  Room and staff quality was excellent I didn t buy a SIM card since I was only there for a day so the icing on the cake was the free phone with unlimited data and local calls that the hotel provided during the stay It helped me tremendously when I was getting around London using Google maps as needed .  The rooms need updating especially bathrooms At least they were clean .  Great location and excellent staff Mimi helped us with dinner reservations our first night and could not have been more helpful friendly Nice restaurant staff as well Beautiful terrace .

The evening meal wasn t the best The food was a bit bland the Christmas turkey dinner was dry and the Christmas pudding was almost as solid as a brick The breakfast however the next morning was lovely .  I thought that the hotel was very good value for money I booked a twin room and was offered a double room at no extra charge for my own comfort which I thought was lovely The room was exactly as appeared on the internet photos and I was impressed by the computer system you can access through the television which allows you to control the heating lighting access the TV controls alarm clock and internet etc The staff were very friendly and helpful and couldn t do enough for you I needed to print a lot of documents to take to court with me the next day and they offered to do that for me and or said I was able to do that in the guest lounge and to say that was probably an usual request the staff were more than accommodating .  Price It may have been good for the area but it was too much for the tiny room and no breakfast Also not good for people who have trouble with stairs No elevator I had a double and there was no room to move around There was also no room for the suitcases In the future I will stay further away and use the underground .  Location is right by Covent Garden Easy to walk around downtown to plays shopping restaurants and some tourist sites Comfy beds The staff was friendly and welcoming .  Had to go down to reception when got back to room as no replacement milk tea from room maid .  Rooms comfortable and large Toilet liked that it was separate but was very difficult to fit in due to the door too close to the toilet .  Pricing is a bit at the high end.  Excellent location in the city centre Friendly staff Good breakfast buffet with fresh fruit Atmosphere of hotel .  Really the only thing I can fault was the carpet it was a bit tatty going in to the bathroom .  The hotel was very in keeping with the age of the building Many original features still present Friendly and helpful staff .  The bed and pillows were very uncomfortable The pillows basically reduced to nothing when we put our heads on them and the bed was very firm .  The location is absolute perfection It is in an upscale area with easy access to shopping museums transportation and of course the State Opera The service from each employee was outstanding .  Double room size is not as the pictures lighting in the room is noisy no fridge water in bathroom switches hot to cold suddenly room is cold so I had to open air conditioning to heat.

In couple days before we check out our wallet was stolen from the room and we tell the manger and they didn t find it.  The staff was very nice the food in the restaurant was fabulous.  the abruptness of some of the breakfast staff some of the serving staff were very helpful and kind the front of house however was quite rude in her approach the area around the hotel doesn t feel particularly safe with a young child There were quote a few homeless people taking refuge beside the entrance and to the right of the hotel on the steps between the main train station and the hotel entrance It put me on edge a little and the smells were fairly unpleasant .  reception staff were very helpful even though the lady who checked us in was being trained at the time we didn t mind at all The room was clean tidy and comfortable.  The bath plug was stuck and didn t get fixed and the glass door to bathroom kept slipping out of Rail. No Positive.

Location and staff were good however the toilet you seat on it is a tight area definitely not good if you re a dive 12 or more that was a big issue fro me.

Room space is not as big as described Air conditioning is a disaster very noisy and not cooling at all just fell like sleep on the train with quite aloud skirr Only two bottles of distill water are provided for the first day stay no fill up anymore for the following days at all which is not 4 star hotel should do No kettle no tea no coffee are provided they even charge for borrowing forks and spoons I have never seen such a 4 star hotel Location is not good on very busy road even have traffic jam at 9pm not easy to go the city centre Have to book Taxi with reception taxi arrives in 7 10 minutes but the drivers asked extra money for booking and coming to pick you up .

Staffs were kind and available for requests and questions . No Negative.  Very friendly staff tasty breakfast with plenty of options The room was clean bright and comfortable with a view over the square in front of the hotel The late checkout option on the weekend was a nice touch The location is very convenient for exploring central Milan only 10 minutes walk from the Duomo .  No free wi fi room as the other hotel We stayed fam room and the carpet wet n inconvienve.  Location ok.  Rust stains on carpet and room service never changed the sheets comforter and we stayed for a week .  Fabulous location to museums and restaurants Renting a bike was easy and convenient which made getting around Amsterdam a breeze Staff was attentive and answered all of our questions .  We had to take our breakfast in the room served in a paper bag every day hung just outside the door hotel policy The prices of the room and all other services are high but I guess this is attributed to the hotel s excellent location .  The location of this place is excellent The bar and restaurant on the ground floor are hommy and very stylish The cozy style room is good size and everything inside works really well .  the shower is fixed and bathroom pretty dated. No Positive. No Negative.  Great location Rooms comfortable and clean Staff more than helpful .  Prices were higher than other surrounding hotels.  Breakfast was amazing rooms nice comfortable and great roof top bar .  More tea and sugar and wider rooms.  Location and room design.  We understand that space is very expensive in Paris but the room I was given did not a square inch to store the luggage not even the minuscule briefcase I had not to mention the six pillows that engulf the bed in the daytime .  Very good and sightly pricey breakfast Very convenient location Well connected with the airports and wishing walking distance from the University .  The room design is a bit old but still acceptable .  The location and the staff of the hotel are superb Never fail to smile and always helpful Thumbs up .  Nothing all superb.  Absolutely fantastic in all aspects staff were very a tentative and very friendly could not fault it rooms were lovely would definitely stay here again.  A bit pricey.  Nice place good breakfast in the cafe next door with good WiFi . No Negative.  Beautiful hotel in an excellent location Was very easy to get to all the tourist sites The roooms were really nice and the staff were helpful My friends and I enjoyed our stay .  only 1 shampoo and one conditioner between 2 people Check in horrendously slow 3 times in queue to complete.  Nice bedroom bathroom. No Negative.  Great facilities comfortable and clean Safe location Nice staff .  Breakfast wasn t value for money at all not a lot to choose from I was really upset to realise the sky bar was closed as that was one of the main reasons for the stay.

Only a service lift for people with limited mobility which was not working on the day we left There was a pool available but you had to pay extra to use it which was not made clear on the website .  Breakfast was very good value for money The breakfast staff were excellent .  You should add peepholes to the doors of the rooms as this is an important security measure .  Rooms are spacious and very well kept Modern bathrooms Tram access very good Close to the airport .  both room and bathroom are very small Sometime noisy at night.  I liked the location 8 minutes walk to the Hyde park and 10 minutes to harrods I also liked the minibar.  We had a room on the lower floor you could hear the tubes running throughout the night and the room was smelling of damp .  The entrance to the hotel and the location .  I booked an enhanced room with a bath tub according to the pictures of the room and a bedroom and a little living room However on the reception I was offered a suite for extra payment only When declined I eventually was given a plain only bedroom accommodation with a shower cabin It is never said thAt the enhanced room has to be a suite or has a bath tub but the pictures are confusing .  The hotel is really clean and spacious The breakfast is various and fresh .  Nothing .  Staff were polite and helpful. No Negative.  On arrival we were given a welcome glass of champagne.  expensive and tried decor. No Positive.  Wi fi slow but better than nothing .  How clean and big is the room. No Negative.

The staff were warm and welcoming and the room was stylish and comfortable the rooms have just undergone rennovation and the decor was very tasteful The toilet didnt flush reported this to staff on reception and they fixed this immediately . No Negative.  Design Size of the room Size of the bathroom Nice neighborhood.  Nothing really .  For us since we wanted to go to the Ziggo Dome the location was perfect We took our bikes and it s less than a 10min bike ride to the Arena square I think they also offer a shuttle bus service Obviously the hotel tower looks attractive especially at night with the blue color The rooms are special with a circle shower in the middle of the room We got free welcome drinks which we enjoyed in the lounge bar on the 17th floor with a very nice view .  Some of bedroom furniture a bit old and worn.  Very close to beach Fairly close to other sights e g Zoo cathedral la rambla Nice and relaxed atmosphere.  Breakfast was poor quality and under cooked.  Staff.  Bathroom and the room was realy dirty and when we are complain on that the lady told the cleaner will comin but never happened . No Positive. No Negative.  Staff were amazing courtyard and room. No Negative.  The hotel was located perfectly by restaurants pubs and some shops Was a very short walk away from the tube which we needed to get to the theatre Wetherspoons next door if you wanted to grab a bite Would definately go back again Staff were polite and very helpful and the rooms had everything you needed including a fridge kettle and microwave Was a short walk from the river thames and the tower of london also .  No table in the room I have booked.  High tech.  The curtains let in too much light from the street To make a cup of tea I had to use the hot water from the coffee machine which resulted in my tea tasting vaguely of coffee .  The staff were friendly and always willing to help .  the drinks were expensive.  The clenleness comfort and very homely .  The pool is open only till 6pm which is not long considering we always came back later than that .  Very good room service . No Negative.  I love the quirky retro style. No Negative.  great location and amazing staffs. No Negative.  Perfect location in Amsterdam the building is quite a landmark on its own pleasant atmosphere and quite affordable.  Centro Fitness.  Location.  The only unfortunate thing was the breakfast Plentiful but quick to get cold as all laid out in the open with no proper heated covers . No Positive.  too far from a metro 15 min walk.  Good breakfast Hospitable stuff nice room.  There is no air conditioning in the hotel though the windows may be opened The proffered fan was helpful .  The staff were exceptional very friendly and all requests were promptly filled The location was perfect a quiet area but also 5 minutes from two tram lines to Central Station .  They do not deliver what is mentioned on booking com and if you want to get what you asked for you need to pay extra.  Large double bed means two small beds next to each other.  There is no swimming pool.  The Breakfast was outstanding.  Hotel located in old industrial area far from everything The nearist metro tram station is more than 750m After dark very unpleasant area for be outside .  Staff profesional and kind Sandra was of great help for us .  Heaterin the room was too loud.  Location.  They charged 10 extra the only things we had in our room which we had was the tea and coffe even used tap water to fill the kettle and the shower gel which in other hotels are free.  Bed comfy.  Room was a bit small but this was nothing compared to the comfort in the room .  Super friendly staff Ideal location close to buckingham palace and other great places . No Negative.  Outstanding . No Negative.  Super Breakfast in the awsome DAS Loft Nice fully white room Fitness centre.  N a .  Bar with good food and tv.  There were no tea cups as such we used coffee cups which were a bit too small for tea but there were teapots The only reason I mention this is that there was nothing else I could make negative comments about .  The staff were friendly and very helpful The rooms were of adequate size with large comfortable beds The breakfast choice was varied and was of good quality A free buffet was available every day in the bar area between 2pm and 11pm There was a variety of small sandwiches cakes croissants even soup and a hot dish Tea coffee and soft drinks were included The hotel is situated on a fairly quiet side street just around the corner from the Arc de Triomp Las Ramblas is about 15 minutes walking distance Also within walking distance was the Ciutadella Park where there is a zoo quite expensive not visited the ports and beaches and the Sagrada familia church If you visit the Sagrada familia suggest you book online it is cheaper than paying at the church and you can select a time slot for your visit which avoids problems It is a very popular attraction There are two computers in the lobby area of the Hotel which are free to use at any time I have no hesitation in recommending this Hotel .  No swimming pool.  Super nice reception he helped me book a ticket when my credit card not working and only have cash A small bouldering wall in gym .  Wifi was pretty much non existent in my room 206 The most I got was 2 bars and I only had reception at the door and one corner in the bathroom Completely unacceptable for business travelers While I added breakfast upon check in 4 out of 5 mornings the front desk cannot find it and I had to sign for it which ultimately caused a long check out as I had to re explain the breakfast charges .  Location wasn t bad if you need to be in the Mariahilfer district.  They could put some bathrobe in the bedroom and the phone didn t seems to work properly but yet not a big deal this is only to help the hotel to be even better .  Very well located in the city the bedroom was very quite even know the hotel is located in a very busy street The staffs were also very polite and helpfull Of course it can always be better but they are not selling the hotel as a 5 stars hotel it s a truly beautiful and very honorable 4 stars Honestly speaking it s a very good value for the money you pay .  Although the breakfast is excellent it is quite expensive 20 pounds .  The location Several tourist attractions are a walk distance and the nearest underground station is only 400 meters from the hotel It is a very classic hotel Excellent in terms of staff facilities comfort and cleanness .  This is so trivial I feel awful even mentioning it but a Jacuzzi on the rooftop would be outstanding .  Fantastic excellent magnificent are just a few words that pop into my head when I think about my stay at this wonderful hotel The room view facilities and staff were in a word Wow What a wonderful place to end my European vacation . No Negative.  Very good relible wifi connection.  Rooms are a little tired.  It is friendly and cosy Home from home .  The bathroom wasn t good It wasn t pretty and the douche was rather complicated to use and malfunctioning Air conditioning didnt work properly .  Nice big bed and desk .  Room was small dusty uncomfortable House keeping was erratic no clean towels provided coffee not replaced no water in the room despite being advertised as such Very noise air vents outside so couldn t open the window Aircon on the other hand was very noisy even when switched off ticking I used to be happy to stay in this hotel but over the past few years it has clearly deteriorated My room requests were ignored every time and the fact that I am a frequent guest doesn t seem to make a difference It s a shame but I won t be staying here anymore . No Positive. No Negative.  In the heart of London Very good service and staff Great breakfast many options .  The room can use some renovation Breakfast was so so .  Super comfy bed rarely have that good sleep in a hotel Room was clean Staff was friendly . No Negative.  Very clean and nice hotel well located. No Negative.  Everything nice.  Room was cramped and bedside table was propped against wall and collapsed when I moved it to plug in charger Perhaps some of the furniture and fittings could be upgraded and re designed to make better use of available space .  Small and very comfortable quiet and cool room with a spacious bathroom on 4th floor Staff are very helpful towels large and fluffy and bed perfect It was a very small double so glad I was on my own Had a cool vibe too Great location within easy walking distance of major venues like the British Museum .  No hot water in room No USB port in room No adapters available in hotel No bidet in bathroom No proper guidance by staff with nearby restaurants Didn t book my taxi Had no idea to the cost of taxi to airport One said 33 The other 38 Ther other 45 Another 60 euros All front office staff It was actually 36 euros .  Not a lot Staff need training Too many mistakes .  Prices in bar were extortionate.  The rooms are so relaxing massive super comfy bed large screen tv mood lights everything controlled by iPad so easy.  As room was in the basement I had no phone or mobile internet reception The WiFi was patchy and the TV signal was poor at times There were cobwebs on the ceiling and dust around the room The shower had no grab rails and as the shower was up some steps it was a bit dangerous Also after returning back late in the evening I found that the cleaner hadn t locked the room door Thankfully nothing was taken but not impressed Also a lot of noise with doors banging at all hours not a restful night sleep .  Friendly reception team and near Bayswater tube station Handy for Kensington Gardens .  My mobile phone was stolen in the hotel and the hotel were not very helpful.  Burger was good.  Crowded somewhat during breakfast.  Very accommodating Walking distance to many attractions and public transit .  All the little steps u had to walk up n down whilst in hotel.  Like the shower n bathroom.  We were upgraded to a bigger room if we joined the H10 club which we did Well I would have hated to see the smaller room Our room was very clean and very comfortable but oh so small for 5 nights and the terrace has no privacy whatsoever due to being separated by others with just a blind so we never used it We also hired a car to get us to and from the Grand Prix well that was a bad idea as the hotel has no parking facilities and it makes this very clear but the local car parks are very very expensive for an overnight stay and you have no other option.  Staff were excellent and room was clean Love the sweets at the foot of the elevator lovely touch.  Between some things that happened to their puor was when I checked in at 5 00 am and after 5 minutes left the hotel I realized that I had forgotten my ipad in the room I immediately called the hotel informing until then oriko told me that when the Housekeeper would get the ipad and they would be sending me On arriving at home without any contact from the hotel for infirmations about me if they would have received my email with the address and bank coordinates I decided to call and then I was informed that they had not found anything in the room I checked the location and I declined connected in the hotel I informed them on the phone and asked for a time that they would check again unsuccessfully So after trying to track the device again it informed me that it had been disconnected with its ultoma location inside the hotel And without much hope I left my secretary in charge to see what she could do and after many emails yricados with the hotel the only response was that nothing would have been left in the hotel when my secretariat began the procedures for a complaint with the evidence Registered on the last locations of the ipad and with the schedules and informing the hotel Surprisingly after a few hours I was informed that surprisingly the ipad had been found as magic inside the room where it had said to have left by means of an email followed with many rollings of how it would have happened but no apology for the happened.  Great geographical location in the city.  Room was very small and view onto a back courtyard and seemed expensive for what it was .  Great location near the Pantheon and close to Luxembourg fast RER tube line to and from Gare du Nord Great breakfast . No Negative.  It was my sisters birthday and her first trip to Lonodon and the staff made it a truly memerable stay Will definitely stay there again . No Negative.  Nice location the beach bus is just outside the hotel and the subway on the other side of the street Lovely beds and luxurious linen Upgraded the room from Comfort room to Silken Club Room that was more suitable for my teenage daughter and me .  Breakfast is too expensive.  Best location you can get in Central London. No Negative.  The location was excellent Staff are helpful and friendly Food and service also very good We have stayed three times and would stay again .  Our child noticed the springs on the sofa bed However the staff rectified our concern Breakfast is on the expensive side disappointed that I had to pay an adults price for a 7 year old Shame there is no pool .  Fantastic customer service staff were welcoming and they all had smile during our long visit particularly the door staff Staff couldn t do enough for us Recieved a free upgrade on arrival Great location .  Bed was far too hard and pillows far too soft .  The location and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly .  bar area can be improved.  Bed very comfortable room good breakfast very acceptable and location excellent .  Non.  The hotel is fantastic . No Negative.  While not in the city centre the tram line 2 bang outside the hotel takes you straight to all the key city centre places without any changes required Excellent breakfast and helpful staff with comfortable clean and quiet rooms Amsterdam is a little pricey but this hotel definitely represents excellent value for money Would love to stay here again .  Tip for improvement we were 3 people in the room and we hated to find our towels in different places than we left them i e they were mixed every time the room was cleaned and we couldn t distinguish which one is whose .  Tram no 2 stops right in front of the hotel direct connection with centre and central station Staff was very friendly and helpful answered all the questions we had about sightseeing and even bought tickets transport Keukenhof for us In the room everything was great no noise and sounds from the neighbours at all .  They should provide more shower items since I need to be requesting for shampoo shower gel conditioner and body lotion It was only one available in a tiny tube .  The location and the rooms are amazing . No Negative.  Excellent location. No Negative.  Perfectly located this hotel has luxurious rooms with excellent beds Breakfast is the best one could expect .  Nothing.  Simply amazing in all aspects .  Nothing.  Everything was perfect .  Certain Staff members could have been more helpful obliging Some were excellent while others were somewhat rude.  Bedroom was lovely comfortable room.  Nothing.  Every thing was fabulous from welcoming till the reception staff food facilities locatin were amazing. No Negative.  Rooms The beds were comfortable the bathrooms were a decent size comfortable to move around and the shower had good temperature and flow control Breakfast We did not avail breakfast while booking the rooms primarily because we felt eating the same breakfast for six days would be tiresome So we had breakfast every alternate day It was very good spread buffet style breakfast cereals bread pastries eggs grilled vegetables fried potatoes of some form sausages vegan meat fruits yoghurt cheese sliced meat condiments spreads and beverages The food tasted good Location The hotel is just a 2 minute walk from the Victoria Station the Victoria Underground and the Victoria Coach Station The bus stop for the sightseeing bus hop on hop off is also nearby 5 8 minute walk These are several restaurants cafes eateries nearby The staff were very helpful pleasant and friendly .  Unfortunately this hotel doesn t serve alcohol Being a young couple of brits this shocked us and was a bit of a deal breaker really but other than that facilities were good apart from the fact our coffee machine in the room didn t work which wasn t a huge issue as neither of us are really big coffee drinkers and I m sure if we requested it to be replaced it would have been as the staff were very helpful .  Nicely located right next to a tram stop that is about a 20 minute ride into the centre really easy to get around and the staff at the hotel were more than happy to help in navigation Bathroom was lovely really modern and very clean the bed was comfortable and we slept well both nights with very limited noise considering it s located next to a main road .  Bar service could be better.  Nice room.  The room was difficult to find and I got lost several times with my heavy case The receptionist should have given better directions The very comprehensive folder in my bedroom stated there were complimentary biscuits but I failed to find any .  Staff were very very helpful helped me with my case without my needing to ask for assistance Room was great bed was very comfy .  No air conditioning.  Excellent location and very friendly staff.  There was nothing I didn t like .  It was a pretty standard hotel for a family It met my expectations .  Breakfast was average and the walls seemed too thin could hear movements across the hotel Room was also pretty dark which made getting ready a little tricky Shame that at this time of year there was no access to the rooftop .  Great location friendly staff who went the extra mile to make you feel comfortable Lovely quirky well designed rooms Excellent amenities would definitely recommend .  Varieties in the breakfast buffet very limited Thus to have an omelet in the morning you have to pay for it That part i did not understand from an Excellent Hotel and Staff .  Staff are Well Trained very helpful Location is amazing Food was great. No Negative.  Overall we had a great stay the hotel is in a great location the room was small but fine for 2 people clean and well serviced each day with towels bed linen etc the breakfast was good not a lot to offer on cooked food but a great selection of fresh fruit bread cheese cold meats cakes etc and good coffee the staff were also very helpful a good hotel at a reasonable price. No Negative.  Near many restourant. No Negative.  We were lucky enough to get a superb upgrade Even without that we would have been impressed but that was a clincher What a view The photos say it all Very convenient location Definitely one of the best for access to central London .  Nothing.  Great deal for money luxury hotel at good price . No Negative.  the hotel is very modern and the staff are really friendly the skylounge has incredible views and a great atmosphere the rooms are really modern and have a imac.  On the downside 2 single duvets for a king size bed The sink was clogged and requested to be sorted but nothing was done.  Clean Although the room was facing the main road it was very quiet during the nite .  The staff on reception at least the one we encountered She could hardly speak English and her manner was brusque All other members of staff were friendly The wi fi It doesn t work unless you upgrade to a more expensive room which is what they encourage you to do on arrival The breakfast Not enough fresh fruit or veggie options it seemed very expensive for what was on offer although my carnivorous husband thought it was ok Stuffy room the windows can t be opened so you have to have the air conditioning on all night .  The location is great Near shops and restaurants and not far from the tube station or bus stops The rooms are perfectly adequate Inexpensive by London standards . No Negative.  Great staff very helpful Nice clean and well appointed room very comfortable bed and all that a quick work trip to london needs.  I did not like to stay only 2 days .  I loved everything but I have to underline the staff they are very sensitive always there for you and the deco simple and amazing .  I was sharing a suite with my mum who is 82 years old and I requested a room with a shower but unfortunately they have no rooms with separate shower cubicles All the rooms have bath tubs with shower attachments and my mum was unable to use this I also found when I used the shower in the bath tub the water was escaping through the glass door onto the floor no matter how careful I was The bathrooms are very pretty but could do with an update .  The property is situated right in the centre of town so is perfectly placed to get to everything You can easily walk to the main shopping street the Hotel Sacher and the Opera House It is in a pedestrian cobbled street where there is an amazing organic restaurant called Christina Rojik Die Biowirtin and the service there is excellent The hotel is small traditional cosy and beautiful Nespresso machine in the bedroom Complimentary coffee cakes and fruit in the lobby All the staff were super friendly especially Brunner Breakfast was great and the boiled eggs were always perfectly done just set egg white and runny yolk .  The spa is not very spacious and costs 15 per person for 2 hours extra The shower in the bathroom was annoying as the water pressure was very low and the plates that were on the shower floor shifted and tilted while stepping on them I was afraid that I might fall The light in the bathroom and room is not good for applying makeup Confusing lighting system in the room .  The bar on the ground floor was good The rooms are spacious and have a good modern design The bathroom offers a good hair dryer The spa is nice and offers some relaxing things like a steam bath a salt grotto almost like a pool and a Finnish sauna the spa is not suitable for children . No Negative.  Very comfort room with a beautiful street view central location very clean hotel.  Value for money but hey this is London and very central.  The location 200m from Liz s house and opposite the Royal Mews The staff were extremely good professional polite sincere I fully appreciate the investment in people that this hotel chain has adopted The Breakfast especially the Egg man Value for money .  Hotel just wasn t even close to the standard I expected from the price Waited 15 minutes trying to call room service to have water brought up Called reception and the girl said we don t have room service so you will have to go the restaurant and get it yourself not the hospitable answer for sure And hotel overall smelled funky Especially lobby area and elevators Had a really mediocre meal in the upstairs pricey restaurant and fortunately they removed it from the bill Beware that pool is tiny and cola with very limited seating area Design and price attempt to establish this hotel as high class but service and food says otherwise .  Nice design style and overall pretty boutique hotel .  The hotel was very filthy I stayed for an overall 8 nights the coffee I poured myself in the room on the first day of check in was still sitting in my room 4 days later not cleaned After complaining to the manager I was promised increased diligence will be taken the following day on cleaning Guess what I found in my room the next evening same cup of coffee This happened an additional time during my short 8 night stay The carpet was filthy with hair from previous guests I presume The rooms are very small particularly if your are targeting customers coming to shop as there s barely enough room to place your bags and still manage to manoever around the room However small rooms are manageable but cleanliness for the amount of money paid is a non negotiable I picked up bites on my legs that are now very easy to attribute to the levels of unhygienic rooms .  The hotel is in a very very good location particularly for overseas clients coming in for shopping and general business in London . No Negative.  Clean fitness spa Masage rooftop swimming pool good food. No Negative.  Staff were really friendly and helpful Easy to get to O2 Good check out time Fantastic breakfast .  nothing really it was just fine for what we needed .  A couple of tram stops from main museums well walking distance really 5 tram stops from central station and close to canal ring.  No water to drink in the room Relatively small room.  Great staff and location Great Conceirge service Thank you Walter.  We hadn t actually booked a table for breakfast and the staff were reluctant to let us in even though we had paid a deposit for any expenses The restaurant was clean and tidy Not value for money .  Comfortable place to stay Handy for the tube .  View from rooftop from one side is of a construction site at the minute and the bar wasnt open at rooftop pool but this is understandable as our visit was off peak The pool was also slightly cold but these are small things which did not affect our overall experience .  Although it is sightly out of the way from the city centre in the Forum part of the city 20 euro in a taxi The metro Tram and taxi rank are all within 30 seconds of the front entrance The Hop on hop off bus stop is also located close to the entrance Massive shopping centre short walking distance away with food and 3 floors of shops Staff are friendly hotel is clean and modern and the rooftop pool is accessible and was quiet when we visited October .  Absolutely nothing .  I would struggle to find a fault with this hotel it is so well constructed and so well run . No Negative.  Excellent location Very efficient check in out service .  nothing really I got the room on sale b c it was July in Paris but it s a little on the steep side ordinarily however you get what you pay for in Paris .  Pretty much EVERYTHING it s a boutique hotel with luxury amenities It s small yet sophisticated and intimate I happen to love Christian LaCroix and his designs and they are definitely reflected in the decor as it s a very unique place Additionally I found the staff to be super helpful and hands on and willing to do all those little extra things that really do matter The location is terrific and Le Marais is at your doorstep literally I really can t say enough good things about this little gem Bravo Hotel du Petit Moulin Bravo .  No downsides No dislike.  Great location .  Broken lift was very annoying thing although the staff helped in lifting luggage.  great location but very small single room .  No phone signal .  Great positioning for the Southbank Amazing Bar over looking the Thames .  everything except location .  location.  Breakfast was very disorganised had to que to get a juice then que to actually get breakfast so by the time we were sat to actually collecting ur meal was about 30 mins.  Staff were very friendly . No Negative.  Great breakfast eager to please from the doorman to the front desk operators Beautifully apointed suite .  Could have had fresh orange at breakfast the first day but did the second day when we mentioned it.  The room was spacious for 5 guests the facilities were clean the staff were very helpful on the front desk and welcoming Excellent location Rooms warm and comfortable Quiet road Receptionist brought us extra milk and teabags within 5 minutes when asked for Excellent kitchen facilities Breakfast was adequate and staff in dining area kept food replenished and area clean .  The maid service is iffy We stayed for 6 days and only had our room cleaned for 3 of those days although we left early in the morning and didn t return till mid afternoon The biggest problem is the design of the rooms especially the bathrooms It s as if the designer thought how can I make this bathroom as difficult as possible to use The sink takes up half the room leaving no room for storing toiletries but it s so badly designed that the water only trickles out because otherwise the sink would overflow The taps are round and smooth so you can t turn them off with wet hands which is kind of the point of using them You have to walk under the shower to set the temperature so you freeze or boil while doing so The rooms even for Paris are extremely small so you end up with bruises from constantly tripping over furniture Too bad because it s a wonderful location and the front desk staff are great .  The location is perfect and the front desk staff friendly and knowledgeable.  Better lighting in the bathroom around the mirror my partner hated it when she tried to put make up on.  good facilities in room.  Probably the worst hotel bed I ve slept on from anywhere I had a double bed and there were two deep bumps in each side like someone had been sleeping there for years The middle had a huge hump I ve never seen such a bad mattress Also this was waaaaay overpriced for what I got out of it .  Design was nice Location was great .  The neighborhood was full of life and shops however it was a bit noisy .  Very kind and friendly staff Nice location with metro station just outside the hotel The room was very comfortable with balcony The bathroom was a bit narrow but it didn t cause any problem Extra credits for the beauty kit with Garnier products . No Negative.  The location was very good Room was clean and good size .  Room and bathroom size very small No mirror in the room.  Excellent view of the Eiffel Tower and the location of the hotel Comfortable bed .  Noisy ventilation can t turned off Expensive breakfast. No Positive.  Extremely expensive for the small room we had which were not cleaned the first day spend a lot and they do not even replace the nespresso capsule 4 stars only because its Paris elsewere would rather reach 3. No Positive. No Negative.  Ideal location for Chelsea and Fulham. No Negative.  Good hotel and Location to Champs Elysees street and Triumphal arch.  Breakfast is very poor. No Positive.  It was supposed to be a quiet room but my neighbors were really noisy I found my room small The breakfast selection was poor .  The staff were really nice and helpful They gave me a quiet room .  Room on first night very small and very hot Air con not working If I had known room so small I would of paid more for better room Thankfully got upgraded to bigger room second night.  Staff very friendly n helpful lovely hotel around entrance and lounge areas.  Breakfast wasn t catering for Westerners .  Location easy walking distance to Everything . No Negative.  Towers are always great Breakfast is as well .  We were told breakfast was available at 16 but when we walked outside it was advertised at 4 95 Needless to say we ate elsewhere .  A lovely quiet clean room like being home from home .  Room was a little too warm and even with air con on it wouldn t cool down Possibly need stronger air con as was waking up in the night as so hot and can t open window Everything else however was wonderful would defiantly recommend . No Positive.  Bar closed at 11pm .  Fantastic location and really only 5 6 minute walk from Paddington station and Hyde Park Kensinton Gardens Beautiful area felt safe and concierge staff were extremely helpful professional and friendly Would stay there again and highly recommend .  A man that was in the entrance of the roof terrace didn t let us get in the terrace saying that it was was fully booked We went inside to find a place but we couldn t find anything so we went back to the terrace as I had seen there were many empty tables There was a nice lady who saw the card of the room and told us we are their guests so we can enter Maybe the man should ask if we stay in the hotel or not and let us enter so not ruin our experience Receptionists were really nice .  Brand new hotel nice view.  The beds are small Also the area can come across as a bit nasty at night .  Value for money Expected a lot worse for this price Also all rooms do indeed have windows I booked 7 rooms for a group booking and all had windows which it says it doesn t on the discription In fact this hotel presents better value than most centrally located value options around Hyde park Paddington and other central discount hotel hotspots Breakfast was good for that price .  The size of the room was too small .  Fantastic Staff very friendly and helpful Wonderful location A few minutes walk to Paddington underground Amazing breakfast .  The room was spacious enough however walls are very thin When napping during the afternoon I could hear the laughter screams of people in their rooms which was very annoying .  The staff were very accommodating of my requests and even went the extra mile to make me feel special on my birthday I had the most amazing and relaxing massage would definitely recommend a trip to the spa The room was neat tidy and spacious enough The hotel itself is a 10 minute walk to Placa Catalunya which is extremely convenient and it s by a road which has a lot of taxi s that drive through so was easy to grab one to go to where I needed to Really loved the location .  Tiny room Room on the noisy street side Previous stays I had rooms on the quiet street side .  Location Nice staff.  nothing everything was excellent.  location bed ambiance decoration breakfast.  I had miscalculated the consequences of the hotels location I traveled by public transport and the hotel is located on a business park After office hours the route from Holendrecht Station to the hotel felt slightly unsafe The hotel offers a shuttle service I don t know specifics so it doesn t have to be a problem A solo walk to the Ouderkerker plas nearby on a nice summer night however wasn t an option in my opinion .  It s a nice hotel with nice and clean rooms Staff is friendly .  Bug trap behind the pillows under the mattress Massive disappointment Mentioned to receptionist on checkout .  Bed extra comfy Food lovely staff helpful rest of room clean and well presented . No Negative.  Comfy duvet spacious studio Ideal for up to 4 adults great view of the London eye and a special message on the window written for my birthday wishes and a bottle of wine balloons Front reception staff were very welcoming and professional .  its a very good hotel at its standard of 4 stars.  Customer service Facilities cleanness staff .  No suggestions .  The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful throughout our stay and meal bar service were excellent Our room was beautifully clean and comfortable with fantastic views .  Occasionally our key malfunctioned and didn t work in the door .  Staff were friendly and helpful Breakfast was excellent Spotless and modern decor . No Negative.  Friendliness of staff Quickness of service Excellent reception desk for all purposes Awesome food Perfection of Lobby atmosphere and service.  Breakfast.  Location.  Breakfast for vegeiterian was very unsatisfaying And the coffee was tasteless From 9 am there was huge line in the breakfast Room bit small even the bigger one.  Everyday there was cookies and mineral water Location great hotel very clean.  That i had to leave.  Location.  The shower was cramped and water sprayed on the floor of the bathroom But we know that this sort of thing is typical in many European hotels and it really didn t bother us at all .  This hotel has the best service and most friendly staff we ve ever had anywhere and we ve traveled around the world so this is really saying something Staying here is more like being in a bed and breakfast or someone s home than a hotel because everyone treats you like you are a special and cherished guest Everyone also speaks excellent English and they genuinely want to ensure that your visit to Paris is perfect Everyday there is a 3 hour afternoon tea with free sweets savory snacks and non alcoholic beverages you can also purchase alcoholic drinks from the bar Breakfast is amazing with hot eggs bacon beans and sausages not to mention fresh fruit breads and pastries yogurt and much more Our room was large and comfortable and the beds were good The windows in both the room and the bathroom could be opened wide something I always appreciate The mini bar is stocked with a range of water soft drinks and fruit juice and it is free for the guests They do charge for refills but we didn t drink it all up in our four days here The fridge is large enough to hold a bottle of wine or two and the hotel will gladly provide a bucket of ice if you need to chill a bottle quickly The wifi is very good though you do have to sign in again each time you use it The hotel also offers a portable wifi device about the size of a deck of cards that you can carry with you as you explore Paris This allows you to access the internet and googlemaps from anywhere as well as send photos to your friends at home to make them jealous The charge for this device is only one euro a day which is a fantastic deal It worked very well for us and we think it is a simply brilliant idea for a hotel to offer this to guests who may not have a local mobile phone The hotel is just a few blocks from the Arc de Triomphe in a quiet non touristy neighborhood There is a small grocery store in the same block and many restaurants and cafes nearby .  Everithing. No Positive.  The friendly attitude of the staff shortage.  Good located near by cental station and good quality room condition .  Cold water in shower.  Friendly staff 24 hour service Good available.  Lack of hot water in the room so not able to shower and having to boil kettles to wash so it defeated the object of a relaxed weekend .  The bed was lovely and comfortable the room spacious and the location great.  Nothing.  Every thing in the hotel is great.  Nothing .  Fab location v posh hotel .  The bed could have been more comfortable and probably could have done with being replaced The steam room in the spa didn t work but it didn t really spoil our stay .  Food in the pizzeria and spice restaurant was excellent and the service was great too Rooms were comfortable and had all the facilities that we needed and the location was excellent being right in the heart of canary wharf and close to tube and DR links Staff were friendly and helpful giving a lovely relaxed atmosphere to the hotel which was very welcome after a hard day We would definitely stay again .  Wallpaper.  Location.  Lounge area could have been larger and more comfortable Decor was a little stark though I expect trendy .  Location cleanliness and staff . No Negative.  The location and the staff. No Negative.  Good location Easy access to various tube lines.  Scrambled eggs not fluffy Quilts were not large enough.  Large breakfast selection.  I did not realise it was a non smoking hotel so my bad .  General satisfaction of the staff the room was ok .  No gym sauna at hotel.  Location is fantastic just in front of metrostation. No Negative.  Excelent Room Excelent location .  breakfast was not really French .  great people .  The room was a bit small but nothing that would prevent me from staying again .  Clean and modern The location was great paseig de gracia is two blocks away Gothic area is also walkable The staff was great Nespresso machine in the room along with bottled water soda and beer A small bar downstairs Also it smelled really nice . No Negative.  This hotel is in a great location as its a 5 minute walk from Tottenham Court Road tube station The staff are friendly and the breakfast was great with a huge choice of food It was very good value for money .  Rooms need a revamp Drawer handles missing cracked floor tiles and bath Very loud air con which we had to turn off . No Positive.  I have stayed at this hotel before and normally everything is fine on this occasion the PC responsible for coding the key cards was not working so no access to your room without a member of staff accompanying you to unlock it the kitchen were unable to do any food due to a problem with the gas and presumably this is the reason why there was also no hot water I understand that things do go wrong but I don t accept that it couldn t have been fixed over the time period it happened Also the staff didn t seem to know what was going on communication could have been better . No Positive.  Nothing.  Easy access pleasant and helpful staff great choice of breakfast .  The lift didn t feel safe our room queen of Wales was the size of a shoe box which had a hard bed It was very dull and had the smallest TV I ve seen in years The room view was of another part of the building and we could see straight into their rooms Shower cubicle couldn t be used as the drain was blocked I almost flooded the bathroom The climb into the bath for a shower is a little dangerous and there was black all around the seal of the bath and some tiles I also got locked in the bathroom Luckily my partner was there to open the door from the outside When asked online if we could pay to check out an hour later we were told it would cost us 100 .  The staff were so friendly and couldn t do enough for us Booking com stated breakfast was 21PP yet upon arrival it was only 10PP the food was absolutely lovely The style of the hotel is gorgeous and the location was fabulous for what we needed a trip to the NY fireworks .  Nothing.  I will stay there again.  Poor coffee and tea making facilities no iron awful smell from the drains dodgy light fittings Woke up very early due to trains and building work outside window Wouldn t advise upgrading to an executive room as it certainly didn t feel or look like one .  Good location quick check in fairly helpful staff . No Negative.  The location was perfect so close to Old street underground station which was only a few stops from Euston and really close to Shoreditch for the bars and restaurants The staff were all super friendly helpful Loved all of the mod cons in the room the bed was so comfy I just wished I d known about the spa so I could have brought my swimming costume Hopefully I ll stay here next time I visit London so I can check it out . No Negative.  Position great reception helpful breakfast good .  pillows not good.  Good food in tavern till late . No Negative.  perfectly central in a great neighbourhood for cafes bistros and interesting restaurants and within walking distance of most things A great spa pool for taking the weight off aching legs in the evenings .  The window didn t fit property Large gap to left side which made the room noisy . No Positive. No Negative.  So close to the Train Station Very clean and comfortable Staff very welcoming.  Noise from the lift and outside contractors but i appreciate the hotel couldnt do anything about it Room was small but clean and served its purpose. No Positive.  It was expensive but being able to self cater was a bonus .  Excellent location from where to explore this fantastic city Very spacious apartment clean and well kitted out Great to do own breakfast in the apartment but still be able to use all the facilities of the hotel just over the road Even though on a main road was very quiet at night and super comfy beds Great Wi fi .  No parking available Small room with small bath .  Proximity to museums and tube Very nice neighbourhood newly furnished interior and very good breakfast .  Julian the reception front desk guy was SUPER RUDE and INCOMPETENT in his job When we check in we handed our passport to him he misplaced if for nearly an hour he then realized it was under the computer Shouted at us and accused us not giving him the passport When our passports emerged he throw us the room key instead of giving us the key NEVER ever stay in this hotel no CCTV Zero service .  Near the Metro . No Negative.  Fine bed Well equipped bathroom Lovely staff Great service .  The redone rooms are soulless no character at all The hotel had the type of room I liked and it was empty for my stay but would not upgrade without charging me I saw one of the rooms terrible location where the people smoke and drink outside your window the other perfect The room I was given faced a brick wall This is how they treat someone who has been staying there for 25 years They did even know I had stayed there before till they looked it up After I asked to cancel my reservation to shorten my state I was given the better room You have to book a table in the bar even if you are guest The martinis are famous now I understand but shouldn t a guest be able to enjoy a glass a wine in the bar area I walked over to the Stafford hotel at breakfast time It was full of guests full of life and delightfully tasteful Breakfast is included Not at Dukes Frankly I walk to The Wolsey restaurant and have a live y breakfast at half the price better toast and an atmosphere that is lovely Dukes breakfast room is so dead you feel you must whisper The same when you order tea in the lounge The staff is nice and helpful but it has lost its charm .  I like the location stayed here for over 25 years .  Weather.  Service and location.  While Ethernet was incredibly fast WiFi was poor in our room .  Caring staff at breakfast buffet they prepared special dishes without gluten and lactose Very comfortable bed clean furniture very well located .  A slow response to our phone call when we were attempting to sort out our room when we had waited sometime at the queue in reception .  On arrival to our room we discovered a twin which should have been a double Although it took some time to get through to reception it was quickly sorted and we were moved to another room and upgraded We were impressed with the way in which staff dealt with their mistake .  Everything.  Nothing.  They should improve their breakfast Guests at times need sausages.  Everything.  Breakfast could be better but its ok The bar tender could be more available at his counter .  The rooms are specious very close to the metro station .  The Wi Fi was pretty bad and so much expensive compared to the quality of the signal There wasn t any bath stuf the minibar was empty .  The room was fine and the bed was comfortable. No Negative.  Very friendly helpful and professional staff.  Glass door for the toilet.  Bed so comfy Loved the choice of channels on TV and iPad to control everything was so cool. No Negative.  Excellent location good standard of facilities and very friendly and helpful staff . No Negative.  Great location freindly stuff very clean room. No Negative.  Modern spacious rooms Fantastic shower Helpful staff Great location .  There was nothing to dislike unless you are a really fussy person looking for faults that aren t there .  Well where do I start it was our very first stay in Amsterdam and we picked this hotel due to us attending a concert at the Ziggo dome arena and oh my did I make an amazing choice a choice which started off the perfect stay in a beautiful city The arena was literally attached to the hotel which impressed us and the transport to central Amsterdam was a about 5 10 minute walk away from the hotel and took about 10 minutes overall on the metro so nobody can complain I would recommend buying a day pass for the metro buses and trams as you save a fortune The staff at the hotel were very friendly from start to finish and will help you any way they possible can from the checkin desk to the bar and restaurant etc fantastic and especially the young lad who served us in the resurant on a evening I forgot his name but I know he s from London who has only been in Amsterdam a few months he was so pleasant and friendly and seemed to really enjoy his job which is wonderful to see so thumbs up to him and all the other staff I was that impressed with the hotel we are booking again for my birthday in August and can not wait to come back I did say we would stop more central if we went back as we only picked this hotel for the concert but I don t want to stop anywhere else as it was a wonderful stay and made an everlasting impression well done all and see you again soon x P S when traveling by taxis from the airport watch out for unmarked taxis as they are like vulchers and make you feel very intimidated as well as probably charging you a fortune don t be fooled Use the main airport taxis which is located by signs throughout the airport PPS The beds are that big and comfortable you have to be forced out of it so beware .  The standard rooms were extremely too small for two adults I ve to upgrade to a bigger room as I am tall person.  Hmmmm. No Negative.  The rooms and location were wonderful . No Negative.  Confortable rooms and enough available parking.  It s really hard to think of something I didn t like My only problem was with the AC It didn t have a sleep mode so it was a bit noisy at night But all in all I was lucky the room was air conditioned .  I always book hotels around Paddington because it s easily reachable from the airport and you have plenty of options when it comes to the Tube Hyde park is a walking distance alway so is Marble Arch and Oxford Street Hotel staff was very polite and helpful We stayed in a twin room deluxe it was spacious with a fridge a microwave and coffee tea making facilities Bathroom was large as well There was an AC in the room which came in handy as it was one of the hottest weeks in London Room was very clean and towels were changed daily The cleaning lady always made sure we had plenty of coffee and toiletries .  The cocktail bar although buzzy didn t have the wow factor we were expecting.  Every point of contact with the langhams employees was excellent They really were all superb.  There wasn t a thing I didn t like.  Excellent location attentive staff and very good room service Needed a dr during the visit and the staff were kind to arrange for him to be available in just half an hour. No Negative.  Great location for exploring Vienna Room was comfortable and very quiet .  The room was very small we did not have enough space to open a large suitcase The curtains could not block the sun completely so the room was light and the bathroom was not clean with the shower clogged with hair .  The location is good Near the quadrilatero Della Moda .  Can t think of any .  Great location near the Placa Catalunya area Walking distance to La Ramblas Gothic quarter La Bouqeria and other tourist spots Cheapest and comfortable way to arrive is to take the Aerobus from the aiport to get to Placa Catalunya and walk 3 min to the hotel Underground metro bus station etc is very nearby with lots of shops and restaurants to choose from You can contact the hotel and they will arrange a rental car if you need one for your Monserat trip .  All was acceptable.  Upgrade on the room which was very spacious Breakfast was good and well stocked .  The room was slightly crammed.  Very friendly staff great service and very enjoyable service.  Just that breakfast isn t included and for what you get is a little overpriced.  The staff were very professional and made the stay so much better than it would have been had it just been the hotel itself . No Negative.  Firstly the location was so central for accessing everything we wanted to see by walking by Metro and by tourist buses Secondly the staff were wonderful You can help yourself to coffee and pastries every time you step in the door but if the staff see you they will offer to make your coffee they are delightful There is no bar but when we wanted to celebrate a special birthday the staff were more than happy to provide glasses and an ice bucket and we bought our own drinks at the shop over the road We sat and drank it in the cosy and comfortable seating area looking out onto a pretty courtyard We had opted for a room with a terrace which was on the 6th floor It wasn t cheap but we do enjoy being able to step outside from our room and we weren t disappointed the terrace was spacious with plants at the sides and enough room for our friends to sit out with us around the patio table I regret that we didn t find time to enjoy the sauna etc it all looked very nice We tried the breakfast the first morning and it was so good we decided to have breakfast there every day They thought of everything I particularly enjoyed the fresh summer fruits Little touches like the welcome gifts lovely spacious shower complimentary half bottle of Champagne for my husband s birthday large flat screen TV and helpful advice on the desk at all times made the whole experience very special Thank you Hotel Moliere .  There was a albeit light garbage smell at the aisle probably because my room was on the first floor and close to the street .  The very friendly and extremely helpful staff Excellent location in the heart of the city .  Slightly outdated but not a problem .  Great location with easy access to city centre .  Deluxe Double bedroom was very small for normal hotel bedrooms king size bed but no space for wardrobes had to climb into bed from one end only and live out of suitcase for the week Great for 2 3 night but NOT for a week was informed by booking com that room was 14sqm however that included the bathroom Disappointed with room as a whole Not worth the money will need a suite next time.  very well decorated with marble flooring and solid doors etc staff excellent requested large shower and was happy with this Fresh towels and bed made everyday with complementary water .  All executive Club Rooms should have a bath for the room rate paid .  What is there not to like Coming to the Langham London is a treat unto itself You don t really need to leave the hotel beautiful food lovely attentive staff If you are going to stay here you may as well spend a little more and experience all the hotel has to offer in the way of the Executive Club Lounge A beautiful oasis in the middle of a shopping day to return to High tea and champagne The only thing missing is a foot massage A wonderful experience every time Bed manchester is silky and luxurious it must be a silk blend somehow with high thread count Such a treat you don t want to get out of bed A well heeled group of Guests Pricing strata ensures only those serious about quality are able to stay here a good thing.  None.  Location next to Paddington Station.  Walls of Hotel room could do with more sound proofing as we could hear the neighbours quite clearly though they did seem noisier than usual .  Good breakfast lovely dining room 25 min stroll to the castle and Milan Old town Metro station adjacent to Hotel Hotel in a pleasant residential area close to several good restaurants . No Negative.  Extremely friendly and helpful staff.  Nothing really.  Great room very quiet and comfortable Great spa and massage Super front desk staff.  It needs a soap dish to put soap around the sink And there is no shower cabinet or shower curtain for the tub It is difficult to take a shower without splashing the water .  The room was so clean Breakfast was so delicious and enough Good location. No Negative.  I thought it was well located an fairly functional as a hotel space Everything was available and there was a minimum of fuss for any requests .  Not very good for shopping.  Location to the centrale.  nothing.  Really comfortable beds.  One of the male staffs were quite rude from our arrival.  The room was very comfy and was perfect for a 2 night stay Wish we could have stayed longer Location is also great since it is near the station D.  I have been waited more than 40 mins in the restaurant for my dinner I was really starving and I believed that if you have a group of people need to serve before me you should let me know i will decide if i need to stay or not since it s far from city there is no place to eat during the evening time secondly the room is big but cold i would say .  Hilton standard room clean and big . No Negative.  The staff and location were excellent . No Negative.  Perfect position parking place stylish bar Higly recommended .  The power cut off several times during my stay During these times I was unable to charge my electronics and it also caused the Wi Fi to cut off which hindered my ability to do work .  The view is lovely I was pleasantly surprised at the macrons that were left for me shortly after I checked in The pool area was very nice I wish I had more time to enjoy it . No Negative.  Loved the decor closeness to Pigalle metro which was one minute walk away It was great value Two minutes walk away from the Moulin Rouge .  Pool was a smaller than it appeared in the photos and didn t open until 10am.  Great Location Friendly and helpful staff . No Negative.  Everything It was absolutely fantastic.  not much at all perhaps a discount structure with the local Q Car park as this is quite pricey .  The hotel is in a fantastic location within a short walk to Carnaby Street opposite Libertys and a walk to Regent Street The room was excellent the bar was superb and the roof terrace amazing .  The room is a bit small but the room price is high .  Good location Helpful staff Good breakfast .  The only thing I have to really say I did not like was the price of a breakfast 30 euros per person So for a family of 4 very expensive.  Fantastic family room located in the heart of the city everything was great and the staff were very friendly and helpful.  .  The Reception lady is really nice and helpfull towards any kind of problems The hotel is beautifull the rooms are clean big and quiet. No Negative.  high class facility.  WiFi was painfully slow. No Positive.  Mum s 80th Pointed this out and nothing special happened Oxo Restaurant Ritz and Savoy Grill all did something to mark this special birthday but The hotel did not despite being made aware .  Very comfortable beds and very clean.  The price 270 for one night not including breakfast I could have stayed at the Waldorf Astoria in Versailles for 240 euros But this is London where most of the hotels are overpriced The restaurant is more like a caf bar and not very accommodating if you want to eat after 10 00 .  A stylish hotel with comfortable spacious rooms Very well placed for St Pancras station and a 15 20 minute walk to Oxford Street .  No bathrobe Shower water pressure was not strong enough.  Bed and pillows were comfortable Hotel was nice and quiet hard wood floors in the bedroom were a plus Decor very simple and modern Free wifi and gym Location was great Breakfast had a nice selection .  Would have preferred to be in the main hotel rather than the building next door .  The breakfast was very nice .  nothing .  Hotel very modern Staff very helpfull and location good Converted Bullring opposite Hotel great for Eating Drinking .  Often the corridors were dirty with food Bed time candy only happened on the first night.  Free mini bar and access to executive lounge Breakfast was excellent too.  Nothing .  Dining area in the basement is very cool Looks like a wine cave Excellent breakfast selection . No Negative.  Staff were very hospitable and helpful The room was neat and comfortable Good location many of the major attractions were within walking distance .  WI FI really slowly.  Excellent breakfast .  Booking com genius perks annoyed we didn t get our welcome drinks staff were awkward when we went to check in you had to leave your bags in the reception area right next to the front door they pre authorised my card but I wanted to pay with another and then still asked me to pay 50 security which they then said oh well we ve pre authorised that so I suppose we can leave it the worst thing is that we were on floor minus 1 the noise from the kitchen dining area was horrendous You could hear banging people up and down the stairs this was going on until at least 1am and at 6am you could hear it all again too Massive TV but no working freeview box .  Beds were comfy location is fantastic for the value of the room we had Starbucks across the road literally 2minute walk to Kilburn Park underground station tea coffee in the room shower in the bathroom fantastic Free wifi . No Negative.  I have enjoyed a quiet room .  Room could be a little bit bigger for the 3 of us despite paying for the extra bed.  Front desk Concierge extremely helpful and efficient .  Very very very pooooooor in every way and aspect.  Location.  Parking .  Breakfasts . No Negative.  Everything was great . No Negative.  Staff were extremely helpful and friendly Location excellent .

No Positive. No Negative.  Excellent location Close to great shops and restaurants Ideally located for the tube station Pub attached to the hotel was nice too Looks like it is used by quite few locals Bus stop is right outside the hotel Rooms were a good size with everything we needed .  the late night food was a little pricey .  great modern design clean and easy access to the O2 arena .  1 No free wifi in the room 5 if you want 2 No bar in the room so if you want to drink something during the night take it with you 3 In my room was impossible to open the window 4 No English tv channels 20 total channels booring 5 No comfortable wall power to charge you staff It s a 4 star star hotel but the services are only for 2 stars.  Very good position Close to all Downtown staff.  TERRIBLE treatment by management following a missing valuable We were made to feel like we were the perpetrators as opposed to being the victims lack of understanding and condescending attitude that runs down the whole chain of management from the top We were blamed for finding a scary mask in one of the childrens beds they blamed it as a prank caused by one of the kids .  Location and decor.  Everything was ok for me .  Brilliant central location Easy walk to British Museum Covent Garden Soho theatres Plenty of restaurants pubs and cafes nearby I ve stayed here many times Can walk or bus from St Pancras Good wifi .  Room looked slightly bigger on pictures.  The balcony.  Amenities were average Breakfest average Lift very small No real area to relax except on the roof but not much there .  Overall a great stay Very helpful service in a new hotel Great location and a comfortable room I had a corner room with two windows Would recommend to stay for short a period .  No air conditioning hotel is climatised but it was stuffy without opening the window The road noise is very loud with or without the windows opened Could do with better soundproofing .  View from room was amazing Location was really superb Airport shuttle right by the front door Nice bar . No Negative.  The location cannot be beat The staff was extremely accommodating and polite but if you ask a question to the wrong person they are immediately going to tell you that they don t answer that particular question and you should ask the next person I made the mistake of asking the concierge for a question that the check in person was to answer only to be reminded by him that he was the concierge it was not his responsibility to answer the question and to ask another person at the desk All I asked was whether I should dial o before the number in Paris In addition depending on who you have seating you in the restaurant they are either adamant that they will serve you breakfast or that you should get up yourself as it is a self serve All in all the location is amazing as you can walk everywhere The cleanliness can t be beat and I would certainly book there again . No Negative.  Everything amazing hotel A cake was brought up to our hotel wishing us a happy anniversary was a lovely touch I will definitely stay here again we was made to feel so special by all the staff would highly recommend to anyone Thank uou.  The room solely had a window to the indoor pool area Hardly any natural ligh a bit at least from the glas roof above the pool From the pool there was an extreme smell of cloride in the room and you could obviouls not get any fresh air Upon request the room could also not be changed Very poor value . No Positive.  Nothing It was perfect .  The decor of the hotel was beautiful and stylish sympathetic to the history of the building with a modern twist The rooms were small but very cosy and the idea of having a pantry with tea coffee and complimentary snacks at the end of each floor was lovely The bars and restaurant were beautiful .  A couple came in late 01 45 and then spent around two hours arguing I think they were above me I was extremely tired and ended I with a migraine the next day .  The room was lovely the facilities in the room excellent and the luxury bath products a real treat The staff friendly .  Everything was just fine Just one late evening we called housekeeping to find that it was on an answering machine and never really got back to us Luckily it was not an urgent request but it was a bit odd .  Since we were staying for 7 days they allocated us a bigger room which was good Brunswick Square is across the street and has a Sainsbury local as well as Waitrose and many food places Pret Tescos and Russell Square Tube Station is down the road Excellent location .  Having to cross the road from the accommodation to reception and the dining room .  Very close to Marylebone Railway Station that is why I chose it Everything was very clean and the en suite shower was excellent All of the fittings in the bedroom and en suite appeared to be brand new .  The interiors and rooms are quite industrial in design but you need to step back and appreciate the design elements throughout the hotel and colour tones that compliment the city environment.  Excellent breakfast selection cooked breakfast made to Oder at no extra cost waiter service for coffee juice etc nothing was too much Great central location with all main attractions in walking distance Bar staff in the evening attentive excellent roof top plunge pool great to relax by after day out seeing the sites recommend for a great weekend break On arrival welcome drink whilst you checked in unexpected but really nice touch as was the complimentary water in room and bottle of wine on our first night whilst staying Recommended .  When we visited Paris temperature was touching 32 degree Room AC was not working properly First it was very slow It used to take at least 1 hour to lower the temperature by even 2 degrees Second it never went below 24 25 even though we tried setting it to 20 Problem was not resolved even after informing the staff .  Staff was friendly. No Negative.  Great value for money clean and tidy staff very helpful Would 100 stay again .  There isn t any sound proofing We had the room behind reception so we can hear all the guests coming in and out and talking in the hallway Generally wasn t an issue as it seems most guests were in by the time we went to bed although there was one night someone was taking a shower at 1am and we could hear the sound of the shower .  The staff was super friendly and helpful and generally very pleasant to deal with There was a small kitchenette complete with cookin utensils for basic cooking so we were able to save some money by having breakfast in our room before we started the day Location was excellent only a 5 minute walk from the Tube and there was a supermarket just outside the station for the previously mentioned breakfast We really enjoyed our stay . No Negative.  Fantastic hotel and staff couldn t have asked for more.  Asked for drinks in the hotel in the evening and although there were reception they said they had a big function on and had no one to serve drinks Rather disappointing as we were celebrating our fiftieth wedding anniversary Would say though that we hadn t had this problem before .  Stayed here previously Ideal to stay a night or two when coming from airport Very convenient because it is near the railway station for onward journeys .  A manual to use the 3 remote controls .  extremely convenient to all transport systems Very clean food excellent great value for money Will definitely stay again. No Negative.  Everything just as it should be.  The shower in the room was great but opening the door before the water in the shower drained would flood out into the bathroom even with having a towel down .  The bed was comfortable the room size was perfect for 1 or 2 people I was shocked at how big the shower was which was a nice change to a lot of the smaller bathrooms I have dealt with in London hotels .  Lack of replenshing of toiletries when consumed But a minor thing .  The location was perfect in the centre of everything The suite was generous in size and comfortable .  there was 1 guy on the bar on the sat evening a young guy in his 20 s he could not have been more rude if he tried he wasa the most ignorant person we met our whole trip . No Positive.  I cannot think of anything that could be improved .  The staff are amazingly friendly helpful and gracious They made my stay in Paris so welcoming Excellent location Rooms are beautiful and very comfortable I am very much looking forward to my next stay at this hotel . No Negative.  All the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful .  Hair in breakfast and food was cold.  Location.  WiFi quite slow.  Clean warm room Location excellent Tube station literally less than 1min away. 7.  Upgraded to luxury room Quite location near Paddington st.  Small room no facility in the hotel.  Location cleaning lovely reception staff.  Beds were not really comfortable No toilet paper just tissues It was difficult to adjust the heater to right temperature .  Location was really great .  Room was very warm.  Bed very comfy .  Although we used the please clean my room we had to ask for the room to be properly clean as they only made the beds and handed the towels It seems they do not used the vacuum cleaner before I could complained about it .  Excelent friendly staff . No Negative.  Hotel very close to metro. No Negative.  Well situated for hop on hop off bus Shopping and supermarket next door Liked this hotel and would use others in the chain around city depending on where I wanted to be Away from the tourist areas so nice and quiet . No Negative.  Very friendly staff .  We found that the Wifi was pretty useless for anything more than emails .  This hotel is in a fabulous location near to the underground which makes travelling too and from De Gaul airport a breeze Smack bang in the middle of the prettiest of locations 10 mins walk from Notre Pompidou d orcy Louvre etc luzxembourg gardens which are beautiful are 1 minute walk great for an afternoon reading under the shade of the trees The hotel itself is sooo pretty immaculately clean and friendly staff .  bathroom may need to be updated.  good room size.  The toilet smelled too bad . No Positive.  n a.  Everything brill hotel room was amazing made it very special with the roses staff were lovely. No Negative.  H10 Cubik was the best hotel where I have visited in Spain Nice appearance sensual interior in the lobby and room was clean and comfortable And the location is also good to walk and take the metro I really want to visit here again .  Room is a little small.  close to the central station the building is old but facilities is good There is capsule coffee machine in the room Breakfast cost 20 .  No bars directly outside hotel at weekend.  Short train journey to centre Staff were good and rooms were very clean excellent wifi.  The room was too small .  The Staff was so good The location was so convenient . No Negative.  Beautiful decor loved the cigar bar great ambience delicious cocktails and perfect service .  The location is just bordering on inconvenient It helps that they have a shuttle service but this has limited hours And while there is a bus station that is walking distance away in principle it involves walking through a dark and scary underpass to get to it Not everyone will be happy with that At the hotel itself my biggest minus would be the absence of bath tubs The shower stall was interestingly designed but I still wish there was a bath tub Finally the elevators You would think that the design would make for more efficient shuttling of hotel guests you select your floor before entering But the absence of indicators as to which floor the lift is already at means that you have no idea when your lift will arrive Normally this would not be a problem But when there is a huge conference and lots of people are checking in or out the wait can become downright infernal I was waiting for seriously almost fifteen minutes before a lift got to me at the 19th floor because of a big convention and it didn t help not knowing what floor the lift was already at .  The place itself is amazing with lively designs and innovations Very clean great service and great food .  View of a dirty rooftop was off putting for future stay .  Clean .  A little run down Members club breakfast very basic Not really to a club standard Complementary drinks only serverd 5 30 to 7 30 Stayed in the sir Benjamin Britten suite Attention to detail with fixtures and fitting could of been better Example turn on the sink tap and water spurts out of the sink .  Nothing.  Hotel is very clean the room comfortable breakfast was good and the staff very helpful but the hotel badly needs a makeover .  Handy place to stay right opposite Gare de Nord station I. No Negative.  Very nice staff and beautiful hotel. No Negative.  Loved this hotel exceeded my expectations and a welcome drink to boot How wonderfully civilised looking forward to next visit .  the location is not so far from the center but it is really a long way to walk to the metro .  the room is comfortable and the breakfast is good.  Room was a little small so we asked for an up grade which caused a little upset with the staff.  Good location.  Construction going on Alot of noise n the wifi signal was bad but great location and very comfortable After construction im sure it will be better Would definitely stay here again. No Positive.  No iron wardrobe is tiny.  Location cleanness breakfast roof garden space nicely furnished with luxury bathroom kit.  the breakfast can be better.  the room is big .  Room was not cosy Too expensive for what it was .  Location was good . No Negative.  Great staff Nice clean well finished room .  Room was very noisy Room 36 It was an adjoining room and could hear everything from other room mainly their TV No window so felt very stuffy actually overlooked swimming pool so would have to close curtains even in daytime to get privacy Ideal room if have kids in adjoining room but horrible for us as a young couple enjoying a night away without children .  Nice clean hotel with close access to kilburn station Car park easy to use and good cost per day Shower was good Breakfast was nice .  Location was a trek into Amsterdam There was a mix up we got single beds had to pay extra for a double bed Even though I had cancelled on night stay with no refund I think they could have wavered the bed charge Staff didn t care .  The hotel was nice and clean bed comfy room large bathroom nice and spacious .  Couples travelling with large bags need a Club Room just to have a little space .  Staff members were very helpful . No Negative.  Very new and modern hotel in excellent location Staff very friendly and helpful especially Demian Would go back any time .  The room originally allocated to us appears to have had a plumbing problem and we were notified the afternoon prior to arrival We were attending a weeding in Central London with an overnight stay and at that late juncture had no option but to accept a small double bed in a single room We negotiated a slight reduction in the room charge but when asked why us we were told that we were the only people staying for one night and so we were seen as easier for the hotel to change our room Not altogether satisfactory for us but there was nothing we could do about it . No Positive.  Bathroom facilities quite old and small bedroom .  Nice location close to tower and quite. No Negative.  Brilliant as always Staff are all so nice and friendly and the location is perfect close to St James underground station but also within walking distance of so many tourist attractions such as Westminster Abbey House of Parliament and Buckingham Palace .  The a c in the room didn t work .  Good quality facilities good distance from the centre helpful staff and amazing view of the city .  Walkable to Centraal Station but a bit far to do each day We should have taken the tram in more often to save our earnest walking for the sights .  Beautiful spacious and comfortable room modern shower Helpful staff easily booked day trips for us All staff spoke English well A short walk to Stoldyjk sp station Tram right outside the front door A couple of great restaurants an easy walk from here Very lovely park nearby . No Negative.  Beautiful bedroom lovely facilities and the staff were so helpful and lovely .  Would have been better if we could have purchased a snack with our drinks i e crisps or nuts etc at the bar after our returned from the 02 in the evening.  The bed and pillows were very comfy location of room was good Was a very easy journey to the 02 by ferry in the evening as well .  hotel staff did not speak any english at check in asian speaking women no hotel staff to assist opening doors or with luggage We missed out on our prepaid breakfast 7 days worth because no certificate was giving out at check in so we didn t know about it until we checked out not instructions at check in at all Hotel would not credit back the cost for the breakfasts that we prepaid for .  clean and comfortable property close to underground across the street Olives the restaurant was quite good .  It was baking hot and there was no water in the room I had to ask for some My room had an adjoining door so I could hear everything next door including their hairdryer at 5 45am Right opposite the staff office to so could hear them talking early too I knew the hotel was full so I knew there was no chance to change my room I had a really poor nights sleep . No Positive.  If you stay longer than one night the rooms are just not as good as your average hotel room Cool concept but for us it didn t work .  The location is great and the lobby has a great vibe to it .  Breakfast was somehow both burnt cold .  Modern clean. No Negative.  The hotel is clean staff are friendly My son loves the cookie given on arrival They even stored our luggage whilst we went to the hospital on the day of departure .  Our original room had a window looking onto an internal light shaft where there were corridors and people could look in if the curtains were not drawn Luckily we were able to move to a room with a street view .  Great central location close to the Aerobus drop off at Placa de Catalunya Quirky reception rooms and great terrace with bar at the top of the hotel The reception staff were most welcoming and went out of their way to be helpful even letting us use the computer to book tickets and print them out For breakfast there was a choice of hot and cold food which was beautifully presented .  Bathroom and room refurb years overdue Bedding didn t fit They had put king size topper and fitted sheet on superking bed Staff not always available Seemed like too few people for amount of guests Kept running out of breakfast items .  location to Hyde Park.  Nothing.  Excellent city hotel location and customer service A very convenient access to tourist areas The station is 8mins way from hotel.  Room space .  Location .  We were a group of 20 colleagues We had booked a few single rooms and a few double rooms but unfortunately we didn t notice that those double rooms also had double beds I noticed one week before arrival and so I immediately called the hotel The receptionist was very relaxed and told me to call back one day before arrival he would sort everything out I arrived one day before arrival of the group and headed straight to the hotel Nothing was arranged the same guy told me to check on arrival the next day When we arrived the next day it was another receptionist who wasn t informed at all I explained everything again and gave him our rooming list so he could prepare everything for when we would check in late in the evening Finally when we arrived another receptionist was not informed So I had to explain everything again for the 4th time We spent 30 minutes after a very long day to sort out all the rooms Not professional at all The breakfast was not that great either It was very dark in the room as the lights were broken I ordered scrambled eggs and had fried eggs luckily this was replaced immediately Not much bread available only toast The shower was verrry cold and then semi hot and then freezing cold again .  The rooms were ok. No Negative.  Room was very nice and very clean The breakfast was incredible with a great selection of everything you could possibly want well worth a little extra to get breakfast included .  Nothing .  Good firm bed quiet room thoughtful extras like slippers Excellent location Friendly staff Did my research so knew what to expect and it exceeded expectations It s a quirky hotel that s not going to suit everyone but if I come back to London this did where I will want to stay .  .  Everything was perfect A big plus for the nespresso machine in the room .  Windows single glazed so noise from road evident.  Bed lovely comfy decent sized rooms for London. No Negative.

The hotel was of an exceptional standard very comfortable great breakfast We also had dinner in the courtyard one evening and the food and environment was excellent Thomas K gave us excellent service and we enjoyed his sense of humor We really enjoyed our stay .  Breakfast prices were exorbitant We CAN pay but chose not to do so Prices were way too high We d also like free coffee or a way to make our own .  Hotel is lovely and the room was well laid out We loved the fact that there were TWO closets and TWO sinks for example Staff was absolutely superb and probably the best I ve ever encountered .  Some minor problems with the airconditioning and with the shower drain Didn t get any complimentary slippers nor bathrobe this time which was a bit disappointing .  Excellent service from the hotel staff as usual clean room and bathroom nice sized room .  Fridge in room.  Rooms were comfy theatrebar reasonable and had everything dining was great Close to everything .  Room very small.  Location.  I wish there had been a few more tables at breakfast time after 2 weeks away and self catering most breakfasts we were going to have a splurge and eat at the hotel unfortunately there were no tables free so we had to go to a bad cafe first world problems I know .  loved this hotel we only had one night but I would definitely go back The room was the duplex with the queen bed upstairs and 2 singles downstairs I think it would have been hard with 4 of us in the room for any longer as it was compact Bathroom was great fabulous water pressure comfy beds excellent staff really friendly and who doesn t love an honesty bar free tea and coffee and snacks etc always available in the lobby .  Would be good to have some tea and coffee in the room.  Great location friendly staff.  there was no gym available due to renovations and thats why I had booked the property. No Positive.

Liked everything about the hotel yes it was a very very short walk to the actual centre of vienna but everything about the hotel certainly made up for that.  Very small bedroom we could hear the lift during all night Not a 4 star hotel.  Location.  restaurants on premises too expensive could not get in and out of shower easily could not figure out how to turn on shower.  bed was great close to shopping Staff was tremendously helpful from the time we checked in.  Breakfast was not good value for money and the coffee was awful The room was very small for the money paid .  Lovely staff location and cleanliness.  The view out the window was a wall Some dust on the bedside tables mini bar wasn t stocked and we would of been charged .  The big clean bathroom the food staff were friendly big bed.  The apartments are super duper small We are a family with four little children and we arrived there with three big luggage baby stroller There was literally no room to move in the apartment I had to move furnitures around all the time in order to open the extra bed open luggage etc This was really very uncomfortable Maybe I should have chosen a different hotel .

We were a group of 5 and there were no tables set for 5 in the Palm Court restaurant for meals only very small tables . No Positive. No Negative.

Miles away from barcalona town 20 euro in taxi 30 minuets journey Metro 15 minuets 1 euro each way.  Near metro nice clean rooms no kettle in the room ask but not available.  Tiny room barely any room around the bed to walk By contrast an enormous bathroom .  Fantastic location. No Negative.  Was the best hotel out of our entire trip The room was so spacious and comfortable The breakfast was great just enough to get you started in the morning to go out all day An added bonus of the cocktail hour and the afternoon tea time int he lounge as well The staff themselves were simply wonderful There was one concierge that was so helpful to us while we were that it truly made the whole experience that much better since we didn t have to worry about getting tickets for tours or anything He even remembered the fact that we were celebrating my boyfriends birthday after just one mention of it They gave us a bottle of champagne to celebrate that night plus a little note It was the little stuff that made us love this hotel We will not be staying anywhere else when we go back to Amsterdam An added bonus is that they are right there next to everything we never had to walk too far to go somewhere .  Would like a fridge in the room .  Only had one night at this hotel but would have been happy to stay longer Beds comfortable My teenage nephew found the pull out sofa bed very comfortable also Good choice of food for breakfast Quiet Only 2 or 3 tram stops from Amsterdam Central Station .  The parking costs .  The boutique hotel vibe mixing contemporary art with vintage finds and most of all the prime location of this hotel near gorgeous caf s one off shops and of near Montmartre make this a real gem in the heart of Paris . No Negative.  every thing.  Breakfast wasn t included in the price.  Location was great as were the facilities and you get a free bottle of beer and fresh milk in the room fridge I would visit again .

Too expensive parking service.  Great location kind and helpful personnel .  Being told we would have to pay for something we ve paid for already The floor in the bathroom was dirty anf there was no milk for tea or coffee.  Had to argue regarding breakfast being included as they were going to charge us twice .  Warning false advertising a double bed when they push two single beds together SHOWER FORCES YOU TO STAND IN THE PLUGHOLE AND STILL MISS MOST OF THE WATER AS THE SHOWER HEAD IS FIXED AND POINTED AT THE WALL WISH I HAD TAKEN PHOTOS VIDEOS THIS IS NOT EVEN 3 STAR NEVERMIND 5 . No Positive. No Negative.  The free afternoon snacks buffet.  We walked in and there were two insects in the bathroom not a really big deal The bed was very creeky and was so loud it would wake me up so I had to try to stay still when we slept The safe wasn t working either and we were really didn t have time to wait around for it to be fixed so we locked out important belongings in our suitcase On the last night the Internet wasn t workin get My husband called reception who explained to keep trying it might start working Not satisfied with this I called back and was told that the problem had been reported but they could do nothing else Apparently their internet worked because their computer was connected to the Internet via a wire but the wifi wasn t working Ok I was annoyed but not the end of the world I went on to ask for some more water we had received a bottle on our first day but it hasn t been replenished I was told it was a welcome gift and if I wanted anymore water I had to come to reception and use a communal tap or take the bottles from the ridiculously overpriced mini bar I asked whether wifi was a gift too As that only seemed to work properly for one day Not sensing the sarcasim the evening receptionist was incredibly rude and did not try to solve the issue at hand I told him I would be writing a negative negative review and he didn t seem to mind A word of warning to the owners employ staff with some compassion and business sense A small bottle of water costs you pennies but the refusal to supply anymore water remember this is a 4 hotel has made me remember all the other faults on this hotel post a negative review and ensure none of my family or friends never return .  The location was ok The night reception person was great when we checked in It was relatively clean .  Control panel for lighting was not reliable always malfunction .  Room was spacious and clean . No Negative.  Staff and suite.  Customer service Staff .  Spacious rooms Large beds .  Only pillows in room.  Relaxing Breakfast Restourants.

Everything Location staff service really quiet outside and inside .  Expensive breakfast .  the room was fabulous Spacious felt roomy with 3 people high ceilings hotel In an amazing location room beautifully decorated lovely bathroom products Strong shower staff helpful and friendly Couldn t fault it .  Nothing.  Plush hotel with everything you would expect from Hilton brand Southwark not traditionally great location but now it is very up and coming and this place is right behind the Tate Modern Lots of bars restaurants etc nearby.  The fried eggs are stored in a hot plate n by the time you get to them the sunny side up is all dehydrated hardened poached Also no luggage service is available.  Breakfast was ample and the range satisfying Front desk was very efficient Breakfast service was so efficient that my table n even my book was cleared away before i came back with my second plate of cooked breakfast No harm done but over zealous nevertheless .  The room seemed smaller than the stated size No drawer space and overall the decor and furniture was more tired than I expected v the price paid .  Breakfast was excellent All staff polite and helpful . No Negative.  Very comfortable and close to Gloucester Road tube.  The waiter in the breakfast is very rude to take my plate in front of me while I did t finish eating .  The shuttle service.  Inadequate and confusing booking deposit system No staff in leisure centre No prebooked appointment Or room requests honoured Careless and non chalont attitude of night staff Had to share the room with a MASSIVE beetle That lived in the curtains stopped sleep Uncomfortable topper mattresses that won t stay on the bed Had to ask for almost everything that should have been automatically provided towels etc Noisy service lifts operating through the night No one around to help or understand that we couldn t get a restful night Came home very tired .  The architecture.  The bathroom was so small that I burned my leg on the towel heater twice The room was so small that there was hardly room for the bed and one armchair It was very awkward trying to move around the luggage on the racks in the room .  Outlaws restaurant. No Negative.  Clean modern hotel Very helpful staff especially at the reception desk .  Rather expensive but this is the going rate for hotels in London.  Nice location very close to Kensington High street tube Staff were friendly and helpful Overall a pleasant hotel. No Negative.  Location walked everywhere I had to go Warm welcome Room decor and amenities perfect Breakfast excellent wonderful coffee .  I did not realize I would get a room in the sous terrain which does not matter But all day and all night long nearly there was noise from overhead Holderdebolder we hebben een koe op zolder Are you elderly enough to know that song Also all the controls were high made for very tall people Instructions for the bath would have helped . No Positive.  The choise for the breakfast could be better I use to eat cottage cheese for eksempel It is not big deal but it could be Nice to have .  The room was Nice and comfortable coffee and drinks included makes more pleasent to stay and work Stuff very friendly and helpful.  Shower needed shelf soap dish but thats just an observation as every thing was excellent.  Reception Staff fantastic and it made up for small issues clean facilities room had all you needed although quite small just a hop skip and jump to Champs Elyesse plenty of bar restuarants and supermarkets high recommended.  Unfortunately we were kept awake one night by the people in the room next door Soundproofing unable to cope with the level of noise that they were making .  The bed was very comfortable The roof pool was a definate plus and the staff were polite pleasant and helpful .  Nothing to add in this section.  Fantastic breakfast and Imperial club lounge access was excellent All staff were so friendly and took time to assist Our room was in the Imperial club it was lovely spotlessly clean fresh and cosy We are delighted with our experience would love to go back .  Obviously had a leak in bathroom as stank really musty mouldy Also odd that a member of staff tried to enter our room at 20 40 Did not complain about these things but wrote all on the form left in room handed to reception .  We had a free upgrade.  Nothing.  Rooms are very modern and clean well quipped couldn t ask for mad .  That I didn t know that there was going to be a extra charge and I didn t bring enough money and didn t get to use the relaxation rooms.  Everything was great I liked everything.  Noisy air conditioning had to change the room No cleaning of the room whole day had to remind three times Personnell is hiding away difficult to reach Impossible to get Melia membership benefits that should be due automatically .

There was a strange sound through the whole of the night and called the manager to try and fix the problem Next day he said the problem was fixed after he sent a maintenance team The second night of course the sound was there It was a sound which resembled a phone vibrating which come from the ceiling bathroom For the 4 star rating is not acceptable Another issue there was not any fridge in the room .  Very classic classy decoration with nice views .  Old smelly. No Positive.  Could use more counter space in the bathroom .  Very modern super comfortable .  Breakfast Service is not outstanding Only ok . No Positive.  nothing.  great hotel.  Staff in the bar were a tad snobby.  Locations was great for a nice walk along the Thames and viewing Big Ben etc Restrooms and room nicely outfitted and super clean .  The pillows were too well filled for my liking giving me a pain in my neck in the end I had to use a cushion with my nightie over it so as not to spoil it with any grease from my hair I tried the others that were in the wardrobe but they weren t much better . No Positive.  The bathrooms were old unattractive and grotty The bedrooms were also far too small and too hot even with air con on Room 330 next to the store towel room meant that I was kept up all night as the washing machine was repeatedly on during the night The wardrobe was far too small in both rooms Over all both rooms need to be modernised .  The bar and restaurants area the decor and seating was very tasteful Also the location was brilliant .  Nothing everything was great.  Fantastic location staff were polite and very helpful very quick and efficient service had to organise a doctor who came to our residence within 30 minutes . No Negative.  Clean comfortable and exceptional staff .  This hotel was way too pricey for what it offered Plus we felt as though the staff was all about the business transaction When we arrived after an overnight flight they immediately sat us down at a table preauthorized our credit card for the entire stay plus an enormous security deposit of 1 000 pounds Then they asked if we wanted breakfast 100 pounds for four and that was after the discounted rate for paying at the desk as opposed to at the restaurant We knew this was ridiculous but we were all exhausted and hungry Plus while the staff certainly was generally pleasant it often seemed like we were the first people to ever ask them to do anything service wise We really wanted to like the place but it simply didn t live up to the cost .  This hotel is chic and for Europe the room was a good size It s on a pretty quiet residential side street yet it s very easy to get to some major attractions and shopping The nice thing is you don t feel like you are in the thick of things .  The price was ridiculous for one night and breakfast wasn t even included even though the receptionist directed us to where breakfast was when we checked in misleading and extortionate .  Location to stadium was excellent and that s the main reason this hotel was chosen.  Air conditioner was broke and was told the technician wasn t available until 9am I asked about changing rooms getting a fan or if anything else can be done The response from the front desk was to open a window They refused to do anything or even send an employee up to look at it . No Positive.  The rooms were much smaller than I expected and there was not much space to move around .  Staff were friendly helpful and personable while the welcome drink on arrival was a nice touch and much appreciated The hotel is situated in a quiet but pleasant area close to Hyde Park and to Bayswater underground station We were also able to walk to Paddington overground station from the premises .  Problems with holding deposits for hotel Room we stayed in on second floor one side of corridor bit small for a couple staying Smell of smoke in room .  Staff were excellent with help and requests and when hotel was full we got complimentary breakfasts for duration of stay as we were moved to sister hotel for one night .  You really hear the people come in and out in the hallway .  The location is fantastic the premises are charming the staff is very friendly and helpful.  Bedroom was small Hotel is small in fact with not much room anywhere for relaxing with a book Even getting breakfast was a challenge bumping into people Breakfast choice was OK .  Good location relatively close to underground Modern hotel with fabulous showers Staff were pleasant .  Nothing .  The Shuttle Service abd the style of the hotel.  The noise is unbelievable the walls are made of boards so you can hear every thing in the corridor and the rooms I was able to feel the vibration of the next room cell phone while am in bed This is tooo much The corridor is almost 1m Wide so you can feel people moving around and luggage being dragged I stayed there for 4 nights and it was the worse ever cuz seriously you cant sleep at all The noise starts from 6 or 7 AM till the night Also the rooms are tiny and small you cant even move or ask for an extra bed This was not the size that was displayed while we booked . No Positive.  Absolutely nothing comes to mind We will use this hotel as our base in any further visits to Milan .  Ideally located right behind the Duomo in the centre of town and handy to most places of interest and public transport as well as a small supermarket just off Via Verziere beside Chiesa di San Bernardino . No Negative.  great location next to the Stratford tube station large shopping centre many restaurants bus service to Stansted asbolutely charming and caring manager on duty Shamsed great service like we ve never experienced before you really have a feeling that they care about your comfort.  Leaving.  The kindness to my poorly child.  Very poor WiFi connection I was able to use WiFi only near reception .  Clean and comfortable room Close to city center and metro station Highly recommendable if you do not care about poor WiFi .  Did not like to pay for fried eggs extra if breakfast is included also breakfast hours finish too early take food away at 10 00am.  Location .  smell inside the room lack of sound proofing which wakes you up at night.  location cleanliness wi fi.  Nothing in this life you tend to get what you pay for .  Beds v comfy Staff v attentive but not overbearing Relaxed luxury not pompous but still classy .  Hand held shower.  Staff was friendly and accommodating.  Didn t enjoy ironing at the end of a hall . No Positive.  Tray charge too expensive putting us off ordering food smart tv did not seem to work well but none of these issues detracted from a comfortable and enjoyable stay .  Given special permission to use hotel parking alongside blue badge holding parents many thanks for this convenience .  Language barrier Room positioning view of another building.  The spa Big room Friendly staff Clean rooms and refurbishment of bath wash and shampoo.  The continental breakfast lacked choice Surprising in this day and age only white bread .  Ideally situated for getting around The room was well equipped and clean and comfortable . No Negative.  Staff very helpful and friendly Fabulous location .  We had no warning about the refurbishment workmen working 9am to 6pm very very noisy Only 1 children s channel tuned in on the TV .  The location is great . No Negative.  The members of staff in the hotel were friendly and most helpful My two friends and I found the beds very comfortable and the room pristine .  No bed lamps.  Restaurang breakfast very good.  the elevator is old very small and slowly slippers lack is inadmissible at a 4 star hotel lucky me that I brought mine from home rooms could be better soundproofed the cleaning lady makes noise in the morning slamming doors.  lovely place to stay in Vienna good position shops and restaurants nearby and easy enough to walk downtown in the city center or if you re tired to take the metro which is 50 m from the hotel big rooms even if a little outdated but clean it was really cleaned every day very good breakfast buffet and the music at the breakfast just loved it makes you feel happy and it s a good start of the day to visit a very beautiful city friendly staff good WiFi in the room.  Rooms need better care descale the fittings in the bathroom clean the balcony fix the lights .  Real close to the city center friendly and helpful staff nice breakfast buffet parking space available for a fee rooms well appointed and adequate sized beautiful bathroom and balcony Note we stayed in a suite on the 7th floor so YMMV .

Breakfast is not included in 100Eur room a bit strange parking 15Eur day is a lot .  Clean nice.  The Wi Fi signal.  The service was excellent Close to metro station.  The single lift that was working was unreliable The second lift was out of action during our stay That is all I can think of as being negative .  The location was excellent as was the standard of cleanliness and helpfulness of the staff Of course the size of the room was little compact but this is central Paris after all What else could be expected I would highly recommend this lovely small boutique type hotel Thank you to all the staff who made our stay so enjoyable .  Two single beds when we requested a double Area was not as nice as other parts of Amsterdam.  Location near to the train station Access Check in. No Negative.  This hotel really is just 5 minutes walk from the Royal Albert Hall We were greeted by name when our taxi drew up outside and a member of staff came outside to unload our cases All the staff were so friendly and we felt we were really welcome The hotel really does cater for individual requirements not at all like the large chain hotels .  Nothing .  A beautiful hotel quirky quiet clean excellent location close to Notre Damm rail link 1hr from Charles de Gaulle Airport superb stay .  Staff parking on street excensive breakfast.  Perfect location clean room.  Spa staff not very approachable and rude .  Great selection at breakfast Reception staff very friendly Rooms were beautiful .

Very comfortable large size bed Twice a day room cleaning service Excellent air condition Excellent location with a lots of good restaurants around the hotel . No Negative.  The staff were amazing always happy to oblige very polite and extremely courteous .  We had a little bit of plumbing issues in our room the water in the shower backed up and it took several tries to get the toilet to flush We told the front desk and they gave us some tips to deal with it implying that it is a known issue In the end it didn t really impact our stay that much at all .  We loved the location and the overall atmosphere Everything was very clean the staff was very friendly and most importantly the location was very close to the tube station .  Wi fi was inconsistent .  Comfortable and clean The bed was huge and the bathroom spotless A few metres from the metro to all the major sites .  At first they gave me a bad room in the basement I asked to change it and they did and it was much better . No Positive.  Good location but a bit noisy because it is located right at the high street.  Very good of having a virtual city travel advise on a handset devise Friendly and profecional staff Very clean and well decorated Comfortable bed. No Negative.  Great location good value for money .  The room was very small even after I upgraded it to a larger room .  The location was wonderful .  They are doing some construction outside hotel not to do with hotel mind but you couldn t hear it Did mean walking round a bit more but it didn t bother us .  We booked a river view room that was fantastic Loved the swimming pool spa Afternoon tea was amazing Staff were lovely Would definitely recommend this hotel So good being near all the O2 restaurants bars .  Nothing .  Right in the heart of things but quiet Fantastic breakfast Super friendly and helpful staff .

The location was great and staff were very friendly and helpful The kitchen facilities were also useful .  Nothing.  Just keep up the good work great people great place. No Negative.  Staff went the extra mile .  Expensive bar.  Friendly staff and comfortable room.  I had a terrible time connecting to the hotel s complimentary Wifi no password needed but my Ipad kept saying cannot be verified We had stayed at this hotel two years ago with no Wifi problems so I assumed my Ipad still had in its memory the hotel s Wifi but that the French police were monitoring all Wifi s now and since my connection was two years old and before the large terrorist activities I had to somehow verify myself and my Ipad with the authorities and I had no idea how to do that In the end it had more to do with the hotel wanting my cookies and I had to re register everyday to get a Wifi connection and agree to whatever this hotel s pop up screen wanted .  Third time staying at this hotel Great location for train travel obviously Efficient and helpful staff Two years ago front desk gave us a room with perfect Eiffel Tower view This time front desk awarded us with a fabulous quiet courtyard facing second floor room that enabled us to sleep with the window ajar and hear the soothing sounds of the courtyard fountain late into the night very restful especially considering we were next to Gare Montparnasse Within walking distance of great restaurants and all that is wonderful about Paris .  Car service recommended by the hotel charged more than advertised Would have been helpful to know in advance that there was extra charge for delay at airport Knowing that arrival time for international flights will require extra time to check through customs Seems that car service arrival was designed to charge more I hope this is not normally the case .  Staff was superb Very helpful Went above and beyond what I expected .  I can t find any fault with this hotel It was all good in our experience .  We had a spacious comfortable room The staff were friendly and the continental breakfast was very good with the addition of a full English breakfast for a very reasonable supplement It looked good too although the continental breakfast was ok for us The hotel was fairly central and only a couple of minutes from Hyde Park so great for an early morning stroll in the sunshine I would definitely stay here again .  20 minutes on the tram to the city center But in 2 minutes walk you can take the tram .  It is possible to park the car for the weekend near the hotel for free Friday 19 Monday 07 00 .  It is difficult to find anything to criticise .  This hotel is in a superb central position so you can walk easily to most of the city s main attractions and shopping areas It is really lovely inside with some beautiful lighting in the common areas Staff were very helpful and friendly Finally the breakfast and bar snacks were really tasty .  This hotel should be 2 stars NOT 4 stars Be aware The Rooms are nothing like on the photos This is small tiny rooms and really old and ugly The rug on the floor had many old stains in it and this is like a total disappointment I came to Paris to meet my girlfriend for only 2 days and this ruin my trip First i arrived at 4 pm The room was not ready I needed to wait for 20 minutes Then i had a key to a room and inside that room was a worker painting the room I went downstairs and the guy made a mistake So he gave me another room That room was really dirty and small and nothing like on the photos I went down again and they told me they were full I then told them i was not happy and wanted to do something about this THEN they told me they had another room That room was a little better but still the same and not cozy at all I usually not write bad reviews but this was a total disappointment Also the price i paid was for 4 star hotel This is NOT a 4 star Hotel REALLY DISAPPOINTED OF THIS AND THE STAFF THIS HOTEL SHOULD NOT BE 4 STARS FAR FROM BEING A 4 STARS HOTEL .  Location is ok .  No got a bad word to say.  The rooms are amazing the views from the room is amazing to.  The bathroom lacked a Shataf which is a toilet washer instead of toilet paper used all over the middle east and islamic countries.  The front desk staff were very freindly and efficient especially a lady called Amira.  Nothing.  Great location for visiting to Barcelona stadium.  Carpet in room Balcony Sofa bed was broken.

Yummy breakfast amazingly convenient location to main train station quiet rooms and comfortable beds Great hotel for a staycation in Milan if the weather is bad .  The small room wouldn t call it a double more like a large single.  Excellent breakfast staff really friendly from reception to cleaners.  We had booked a queen bed room but were offered a room with two single beds pushed together and with two single duvets .  Location surroundings and decor .  Thick walls You can hear everything guests next door are talking about and when opening doors Shouldn t have 4 stars just because of that .  Staff was really nice and helpful location is very good rooms are nice and spacious breakfast is excellent good value for money .  There s no water boiler or coffee tea in the room .  The front desk staffs are amazing We got enough information from them including place of interests restaurant transport and weather It s our first trip to Paris they made us felt like home There was heater in the room wonderful that it wasn t cold at all even it snowed outside The location was a major benefit so many good restaurant at walking distance and 2 mins walking to 2 metro stations .  Booked room was include breakfast but reception still ask us to pay the cost of breakfast back to home check confirmation of hotel is include break so I have to Complaint Booking group .  Good WiFi Comfortable bed near Metro .  Very busy restaurant at breakfast with minimal staff interest as a solo woman was often ignored lack of native english speakers everywhere meant for uncomfortable stilted conversations Not enough milk in the room for more than 2 cups of tea .  Comfortable bed and large room and I liked the shutters which kept out the noise .  We room is nice clean but had a little problem with the bathroom sink .  The room is big and bed is comfy .  Not much not to like.  Bar area.  Delayed check in procedure .  Great location and quite quirky .  1 I had to put my luggage downstairs to the luggage room myself and take it back 2 Too small room and not holding open door to the bathroom 3 A bit unfriendly lady on reception but her colleague was much better.  1 Very close to the center and many shops cafe 2 Really good bed 3 Good varied breakfast and welcoming lady 4 Helpful staff.

No Positive. No Negative.  Very friendly and helpful staff Peaceful location near the Schoenbrunn Castle 10 minutes walk .  Why is the bathroom wall transparent This might work for couples but not for friends . No Positive.  Due to our late arrival we had to have a wet room instead of a normal bathroom which was more inconvenient However as it was a large room it wasn t a huge problem and we didn t request a move the following day which had been offered by Reception It seemed rather expensive with no breakfast included That would have been an extra 21 per day per person .  The room was large spotlessly clean comfortable and quiet Very well situated next to the harbour and close to the main railway station The foyer is very attractive with plenty of sitting and meeting areas .  Quite a walk to the tram station .  Very comfortable bed and a spacious room .  the hotel feels a little dated.  great location nice breakfast friendly efficient staff.  The bed was not comfortable.

Got allocated a disabled room and not informed When reserving room asked for an earlier checkin which they were unaware of On arrival asked again and I was told they would ring me never received a phone call and returned at 1pm to find room was available immediately Room was freezing and it took all evening for the heating system to get the room to an acceptable temperature Had a surprise visit from a member of staff around 8am in the morning check out is at 12 Have amazing tech in the room with no instructions on how to use so spent time working it out No prices for the mini bar and low stock on coffe making facilities and number of towels All in all a rubbish experience which is a real shame as the hotel has all the potential to be great .  Bar area excellent with attentive staff.  Air conditioning in our room 527 could be a bit more efficient .  An excellent hotel with friendly and helpful staff . No Negative.  Only location The worst Hilton we have stayed ever The sink was obstructed the toilet was liking and the ceiling in the bathroom was extremely small my husband had to bend to take a shower No mention that I forgot my watch and iPhone charge there and they only found the charger Don t understand how the watch magically disappeared as it was next to the charger Horrible experience .  Lack of food choices at the bar.  Reception staff excellent friendly helpful Bar staff Sunday evening poor unfriendly unsmiling.  It s London so it s expensive .  Staff were amazingly helpful Vlad is a star Furnishings and decoration lovely room was superb Great location at the Barbican good bars and restaurants close by It really is a lovely hotel . No Negative.  I have stayed in this hotel multiple times in the last few years and always I leave with the intension of returning Very helpful staff great location excellent breakfast nice rooms .  even if i requested to clean everyday i ever found rubbish bin is not empty and hair still sticked on chair .  room view is out of my expectation .  Bath could have been cleaner Loose boiler room door in room was shabby 260 .  Fluffy towels and sumptuous sheets Room had view of mews which was very quiet .  lack of comfortable places to relax Only a very small bar with mostly stools Paper napkins at breakfast are ridiculously small.  Location very good and beside a tram stop .  Requested room on highest floor available months before stay to be given the 1st floor.  Good location.  Breakfast not included in room rate.  Everything.  I didn t like that when I arrived with my daughter at 5pm I was told they had no room for me and wouldn t have anything for another two hours Obviously I was not happy with this at all as this was unacceptable and we were due at the O2 for a concert at 6 30 I asked to see the manager with whom I didn t get to see and was then given a room upgrade later check out and complimentary drink .  The view the room and the very comfortable bed the easy accessibility to the O2 and the staff in general and very friendly bar girl in the clipper bar .  I was in my room when the cleaning lady wanted to come in She opened the door and wanted to enter and was not happy because i didn t let her i was just out from my shower .  Perfect location Good breakfast Staff at the reception desk very friendly and helpful . No Negative.  Best breakfast I have ever had .  repeated problems with room key to door not working requiring multiple trips back down the elevator to reception and visits from key technician It took about 5 days to sort out but the key and lock eventually worked .  nice rooms with plenty of space BreakFast 18euros each but very good .  Nothing I didn t like.  Location and cleanliness were particularly good.  Noisy so had a poor sleep was there for two nights and the room was not cleaned or towels replaced.  Soya milk was availble.  front desk seemed a bit confused with payment card pre authourised but took payment at leaving full payment outstanding for another 4 days and showed on my a c as a debit even though paid in full Sorted but no need for this hassle View of a hotel roof .  convenient for the apollo and tube short walking distance.  The view from the hotel but that s not something the hotel can control I guess .  Free cookies on arrival and service was great from front desk Checkout time reasonable too .  Stayed here Sunday and Monday night 16 17 July The single bedroom was just too small the toilet wasn t flushing very well the tap in the sink was missing a nozzle so water was spraying all over me when i had the tap on full but worst of all is that this room was off the main corridor beside where the housekeeper stored stuff and there was constant noise from early morning There was also some works being done outside my door Room 423 see picture When I checked into the hotel I asked if I could get an upgrade the girl asked if I stayed here before told her no but that I had stayed in a Radisson Blu in Ireland I was then told they were full I really don t believe that was the case at all Also there was no Mini bar in the room Really disappointed that I didn t get a good nights sleep the hotel obviously knew they were doing works outside the door very inconsiderate It costs a lot to stay in London and what I was given and the sleep experience I had was certainly not value for money .  Breakfast was great staff were very nice and location was excellent for the things I wanted to do.  Nothing.  It was very nice I like it ghazi friendly near to everything s.  Design beyond the lobby floors less than a 2 stars hotel appearance specially a very long not ending corridors with very poor design that needs a complete restoration and new design Broken damaged and not repaired door corners Used breakfast plateau in front of a guest door ugliest most disgusting not hygienic thing in a hotel Not even a welcoming small bottle of water in the room Electrical water heater in the room but no tea no coffee At the lobby a luxurious shop buying fur coats but 2 persons inside playing tric trac was very chocky to be seen Taking photos of the beautiful church nearby within the hotel photos just to promote the hotel outside appearence on the internet is not fair at all Letting guest to write their name the country origin on a paper signaling 28 for breakfast than to sign up EVERY MORNING before the breakfast was somewhat offensive not ethical specially if someone had already booked with a B B facilities .  Reception personal excellent Breakfast enjoyable Lobby architecture good .  Bed sheets smelt a little musty Used cotton bud left on bathroom floor.  Quiet room.  No view frosted windows but it was an alleyway though and it s London so I could cope .  Surprisingly quiet which was nice .  Ac was horrible Stifling hot in room . No Positive.  Booked a smoking room and was told there were none when I arrived Booked a room with Eiffel Tower view but I could only see it when I stretched my head out the bathroom window Breakfast buffet was very poor Did not offer concierge or any other service usually found in a 4 star hotel.  Very clean Many cafe s and restaurants around Eiffel tower is about 15 minutes walk Close to a supermarket Comfortable bed.  It did not turn out to be a problem but be aware that there is an automatic daily charge for the minibar which they will take off if you tell them you didn t use anything from the minibar They took it off without a problem but just be aware to watch your bill .  The location is great The rooms are clean and comfortable if a bit small The onsite restaurant is quite good and there is a comfortable bar with a good snack menu So overall a comfortable place to stay and sightsee We would return and recommend it .  Room decor In room facilities Door to room had a massive gap underneath so you can hear everything outside your room Within half an hour we had 4 house keeping people just enter the room without knocking Breakfast times not made clear so we lost 33pounds for 3 breakfasts Staff were rude about it as well .  Location.  My chihuahua couldn t be there to. No Positive.  Meubles desuets. No Positive.  Nothing at all.  The location breakfast and cleanliness. No Negative.  Loved everything Great food great staff great place .  it was so noisy noise from the street that I was woken up several times and could not sleep .  location building atmosphere.  The hotel is near the highway so if you are a light sleeper we suggest you bring earplugs if you sleep with open windows The windows have excellent sound insulation so you can keep the air condition on at low in the summer months and close the windows at night did not hear a thing .  Comfortable and spacious rooms clean and reletivly new The bathroom was perfect Metro stop is a next to the hotel and a 15 20 minute ride to the Gothic quarter Very safe neighbourhood The night falls around 10 PM in June and we felt very safe comming back by metro and to the hotel after 11PM .  The only thing I missed was a table for the computer.  Very friendly staff UniqueHotel location and the sense of security modern Hotel in an old beautiful building .  The location was a little way from some of the attractions I was visiting .  The staff was courteous and friendly The breakfast was very good but the biggest surprise was the food served in their restaurant Excellent meal with a server who was sot on .  Funny smell in the bathroom smelt like Spain with the drains thankfully it cleared was going to say something but didn t have to.  Bed very comfy spacious room great staff.  Unfortunately I got shocked when I come back and found glass on its place and no one clean it This is upnormal for this hotel as usually room service are a good . No Positive.  the size of the room.  atmosphere location and the staff.  The double room was tiny This was our only grievance There was a free standing enormous mirror which there wasn t floor space for It needed to be hung on wall .  The pastries at breakfast were delicious The staff so courteous The hotel was in a lively location near to bars and restaurants We liked the simplicity of decor of room .  Breakfast could be better for a four star hotel not so much to choose from. No Positive.  Rather than having a double bed we had two twins which were pushed together which was rather uncomfortable as we kept falling down the gap .  The staff were friendly and incredibly helpful The park near to the hotel is lovely .  nothing.  Super friendly staff very good location near earls court where you can go pretty much everywhere in very little time rooms are small but very comfortable and clean breakfast is very good .

No Negative.  First things first The room was just amazing Not too small not huge but just the right size Well decorated practical and as clean as it gets Also it s been a while since I slept in such comfy bed It was like being hugged I had forgotten what it was like to have a perfect night s sleep The hotel is located in a very quiet albeit central area And we didn t hear any noise coming from other rooms Surprinsingly the internet conexion was great The bathroom was pretty awesome as well Let s just say that there was a tub and the floor was warm which I found was a nice touch like a cherry on the top of a sundae The friendliness of the staff is another point worth mentioning the airline company had lost our luggage and they went above and beyond what was required to try and help us To wrap it up we couldn t have asked for a better hotel at such a good price I d stay there again in a minute . No Negative.  The staff was very welcoming and helpful .  Poor quality wifi.  Well appointed rooms. No Negative.  Bathroom great bed very comfy very quiet location Breakfast very nice .  Beds a bit hard.  Excellent location and good breakfast Friendly staff .

Coffee and bridge in the room.  parking charges were too for guest .  The room was clean the staff were helpful and friendly .  Where do I start Stayed here on several occasions but service and facilities deteriorated Revolving door not working Bad enough that you have to lug your own luggage in with no extra hands to push door at the same time Restricted shuttle service Doesn t make sense unless driver has other duties One lift out for servicing during busy period Front desk staff complained he was on his own so easily got irritated Pancakes missing for breakfast .  Self service tea with hot water Clean bathrooms Cheerful shuttle driver .  Included breakfast ran out of most food by 9 30 and they served breakfast until 10 30 Get to breakfast early if you want to eat I was told people ate too much and that is what they ran out .

Enjoyed everything thing about the rafayel hotel .  Wouldn t let us park our van even though we paid for a space.  location very close to the grand palais. No Negative.  Loved that the hotel leaves a mobile telephone in the room that you can take outside with u and use for calls internet google maps etc This was extremely useful because general wifi availability outside the hotel was poor Loved the club room too Most days we had breakfast there Was quiet and coffee and the small selection of food available were excellent .  The shower room could use a slide door or curtain water keeps flowing to the toilet during bath .  Great staff perfect location .  small bed not for 2 people AT ALL location of the room in the basement with direct light to the room from outside really tiny room.  location wifi breakfast.

This is my second time staying at the hotel Regina and I would stay the next time I go too Love the location because it is central to everything About 7 mins walk away from duomo 15 from brera and 15 from navigli The street that it is located on has lots of shops and some good ones too so you don t have to always go to the duomo area to find something The breakfast buffet in the morning is fantastic The food is delicious and there are also gluten free options Overall my experience at hotel Regina made my stay in Milan wonderful The service is excellent the rooms and nice and clean and the location is superb .

The tiles were coming off the way in bathroom Bathroom was tiny and cramped Room was freezing with an a full draft both of which lead to me being ill Breakfast was and all you can eat pile of ready meal The food was terrible in comparison to what the hotel looked like and what the cost of a room I ve seen better food served on the front line .  The bed was the only thing I liked and the tech gadget for free calls and maps was pretty cool Buts that s it.  What i did not like is the UN clarity of the rooms category I was booking two rooms category under two different name deluxe room and standard room in which we paid more for the deluxe room at the end i found that both rooms are exactly the same the rooms number were 321 deluxe and 427 standard when i checked with the hotel reception they claimed that they offered us a big standard which i don t understand Next time if i come i will book standard room instead of deluxe room and i will ask the reception to give me a big standard room so i will end up with a deluxe room i would appreciate a clarification.  what i like is for sure the location.

There was an office for staff on first floor located just across from our room There was 2 female staff members there from 7 30am on Sunday morning laughing and talking very loudly which woke both myself and husband Our room must have been above the staff entrance or smoke area because we could also hear staff going in and out loudly also Not what you want at 7 30am on a Sunday morning Rooms are a bit tired looking have not been brought up to date but clean and tidy.  The size of bed was great Kingside and comfy The hotel was bright and very inviting .  nothing to complain it is however noteworthy to mention that it takes 10 minutes foot walk from next undergroound station.

Too many beds 3 in the room Desk light switch is way too high I have to climb up to reach ot Bell boy did not even care However I did give him very good tips 10 GBP.  Location The bar service in the evening w re good .  Service charge added to food bill in restaurant without prior notification Food prices already high enough so I felt that this was a quite cheeky .

The breakfast could be improved but for Italy is ok.  If you are looking for an hotel with a lot of charm and atmosphere a very nice and helpful staff then this hotel is for you The location is very central There s some traffic in the street but it s not an issue when windows are closed The breakfast is not exceptionnal but ok .  I arrived at breakfast within the breakfast window only to be told about 3 times within 30seconds that the breakfast buffet would be cleared away in 8 minutes The food was clearly not the freshest given the time I arrived but still there s no excuse for curtesy and friendliness .

Everything was as expected .  Rooms were well soundproofed Comfortable bed .  Light is not bright enaugh.  Extra sit for double room.  Room was really small and kind of worn Pictures at the site for booking and reality did not match much We were kind of disappointed and would have preferred some international hotel chain hotel instead And hotel was not that close to the Central Station as expected although we chose from the booking app by near the Central Station as we had to wake up at 5 to catch the bus to the airport beside Central Station .  The location of the hotel was pretty good for just walking around 20 meters from the hotel was a great restaurant Il Carpaccio and park for walking was nearby .  Liked everything.  Amazing views from our room Loved our stay Staff exceptionally friendly and helpful In particular Ed the head concierge x.  Nothing.  Comfy room .  a c did not work.  good location.

Very nice and cosy hotel on a perfect location with friendly staff and a perfect room with everything you will need .  Nothing.  Superb location hidden on a small and quiet street just perfect .  The d cor of the hotel is uninspiring very bland with little character The corridors are very utilitarian with a strange brick pattern carpet which is not very inviting and warm The lighting in the bedroom was very poor very difficult to read at night .

Fantastic location very easy to get to the main tourist destinations We had a gorgeous view of the Eiffel Tower from our lovely balcony The room service was also really nice .  Had to move rooms after a leak but it was long winded .  Comfort and location.  Some bee in the outdoor facility during our breakfast bothering us while enjoying breakfast we end up transferring inside to get away from those bees Other than that everything s excellent .  Great river view and delicious breakfast our teenagers loved the gym and the swimming pool Very relaxing time in the executive lounge Highly recommended .  Couldn t have a bath as the auto sink plug wouldn t close Very poor and scarce tea coffee selection in the room just one biscuit not actually a good starter for a guest .  My major like was the comfort of the room The location for me was paramount as I go every year to march at the Cenotaph so this hotel is very close to Horseguards It is warm and cosy great food but quite pricey Staff are very well trained and extremely friendly and helpful although a few could really brush up on their English . No Negative.  Exceptionally friendly staff nothing too much trouble interested in their customers.  Too warm in the room air conditioning wasn t that great. No Positive.  When I check out they told me I have to pay the telephone bill of 45 that I didn t use but claimed me by useing during 03 30 I was sleeping and it was innocence At last they didn t ask me to pay after 10 mins to verify .  Convinence of location.  Small bath room but with separate bath .  A lovely hotel with spacious room especially for Paris great design and modern features Super nice staff Very nice area and close to Metro .  I found out after booking this on Booking com that the hotel actually had an internal promotion stay a while longer whereby if you booked directly through the hotel for Friday and Saturday your Sunday night was free So always check promotions with the hotel directly Midweek the hotel has networking events this was great if you wanted to joint in set menu and late after party with DJ not so great if you weren t expecting it .

Price metro station right outside the staff were helpful .  Very little although we didn t eat in the hotel maybe better value elsewhere when menu was studied.  Location of Hotel was amazing Bay window in room and complimentary wine went hand in hand .

Restaurant not open saturday lunchtime bar menu limited bar staff 50 excellent 50 not happy bunnies Room service confusing charges for a meal which was cold when it arrived breakfast a total muddle the next morning First room smelt of vomit and quickly moved Confusing information re car parking and charges thankfully at checking out the receptionist told us to get our ticket stamped much clearer info needed .  Location attended conference at Wembley Arena with disabled person so perfect for us Quick response to initial problem with room reception staff brilliant room excellent immaculately clean Car park excellent .  The shower did not work properly we needed more towels for a family of four .  Great location friendly and helpful staff Quiet even though it is very near the Ramblas .  Unfortunately the person serving in the bar put the invoice from other drinking guests at my room so when I payed the bill for my room and what I had in the bar the evening before it also included what my neighbor had ordered to his table When I payed attention to this fact the chief of the hotel started to blame me for I had noticed this and complained after I already had payed the bill Before I left the hotel he promised reluctantly to see to it that the difference should be payed back at my account Today one week after this happened I still have payed the bill also for the neighbor some tables away from my table that night So instead of apologize and correct the mistake of the barman he blamed me for having noticed this to late So unusually and astonishingly bad Bj rn Andersson.  Nice classic hotel near the central station The rooms were nice and clean and nice .  A bit far from the center of town but only a 20 minute bus ride that you catch from across the street Bar overpriced but it s hotel .

The rooms were small and dated the bathroom what bathroom and as for the shower they still made use of the curtain which is vile and disgusting .  The pool.  Some of the staff were lovely some were a bit gruff The breakfast buffet was on the expensive side for the quality of food I went one day as nothing else was open but there are plenty of great places all around the city if you re not visiting on a public holiday .  Great location not in a super touristy area but still a very short walk to get to all main attractions as well as several train lines for easy transport The hotel offers a very cheap rate to a gym next door which is handy if you re looking to keep active and work off the schnitzel and streusel .  Breakfast was awful for 16 75 was not impressed at all Will never eat there again My breakfast was overcooked when I send it back it came back cold not impressed at all .  just the view and location.  The hotel is a little tired could do with a refurb .  Very close to Olympia so Ideal for business .  Location right next to St Paul s so all good there Room clean and adequate no thrills but did the job Sky sports on TV so bonus as didn t realise it did have No condiments in room communal ironing board and very noisy at night in the corridors as the rooms are packed in very close together probably didn t help having a group of women crying in the hallway but tough to fault the hotel for that Reception staff lukewarm and slow to check in and out .

The room and bathroom were clean towels changed daily metro station very close to the hotel .  We had breakfast over two mornings On both days when we left the table to get our cooked breakfast staff cleared away our juice and cutlery without checking that we were still in the dining room This was quite annoying.

Loved everything about this place location staff and the room It is every bit as good as the pictures online Great area with lots of local restaurant options .  Room bathroom rather small .  Location brilliant .  Despite the many positives of this location and hotel there are a few areas that could be addressed Strangely the wifi was only available in the rooms themselves not even in the restaurant or lobby I assume this is to prevent random people from using the hotel s network but is not helpful to guests Firstly the hotel interior is visibly out dated and in need of some proper repair work The rooms furniture is old and the fixtures are in need of replacement Many parts of the room such as wooden frames had obviously been hastily fixed or not yet repaired The bathroom showed the age of the hotel the most with rusting fixtures and an old hose style hair dryer both my friend and I gave up trying to dry our hair while staying there take your own if this is important to you The room also featured a very old panel of buttons for a radio that didn t work and light room controls There was no clock in the room and I had to search through the TV channels just to find one with the local time One of the windows could be opened but the other was missing it s handle Thankfully I could open one window as I could not control the temperature and found the room very hot My friend found the same in her room There is currently building construction happening on one side of the hotel not in the hotel s control obviously and they often started before 7am Be sure to ask for a room away from the construction Although in a fabulous location with great staff this hotel is not what I would call 4 star simply based on the out dated rooms and need for proper repairs The star system is not regulated around the world but having stayed in many places in a variety of countries I can say that this hotel is probably now a 2 3 star that once was a 4 star It has great potential to be a 4 star once again .  The location of the hotel is ideal for anyone wanting easy access to historical sites museums shopping restaurants cafes multiple types of transit and walkable routes The buffet breakfast was extensive compared to many hotels and there were always at least 3 very professional staff working There was a wide variety of food so even someone who has multiple dietary restrictions can easily fill up The coffee was fresh and served in individual pots All areas of the hotel were very clean including the room The room had the basic amenities including a cozy robe slippers various stationary tissues Kleenex which many places no longer supply The bed and pillows were very firm which suited me fine but not my friend who found it too hard for a good sleep All of the staff who we interacted with were friendly helpful and showed genuine pride in their jobs They spoke various languages and were able to make many recommendations for best transit options where to eat getting a taxi and informing us of the transit closure due to a one day strike Overall a great place to stay The staff s professionalism was unwavering and makes this hotel what it is . No Negative.  Character of the rooms friendliness of the staff.  Despite renewing works seams to be done recently part of the hotel endowments are little bit obsolete .  very good location. No Negative.  Bikes available Pancake for Breakfast.  The staff was terrible and the whole experience was awful.  Nothing.  Price is very high for what you get It suppose to be 4 star hotel but i wouldn t give them even 2 stars Room are not as good and who the heck connect ventilation that goes in to the rooms with ventilation from kitchen I had at 05 00 each morning smell coming from the ventilation Staff is not really helpful you need to ask them multiple time to get things done This was my first and last time to stay in this hotel .  Wifi is only thing that i liked in this hotel .  N A.  Cookie on welcome Comfortable bed Good time of check out.  Going home.  15th floor and spa.  Nothing.  Real gem of a place Great hotel best I ve stayed in Paris Even has a steam room .  Would be nice if breakfast was included in the room rate The Hoxton grill is great but not cheap for breakfast .  This hotel is basically hipsterville Central Loved the design of the hotel main areas and the rooms All the hipsters parked in the lobby using the free wifi make the place feel homey and cosy .  Not much .  Excellent room with great view excellent dining excellent facilities quick walk to metro to get into city .  We had a room with a view The view was gorgeous but it was quite noisy with the hustle and bustle from the square .  Clean room air con and comfy bed .  Nil.  Every thing about our stay was amazing. No Negative.  Excellent location Clean and comfortable room Basically room for night hotel facilities otherwise basic Great staff . No Negative.  Amazing breakfast So worth getting Comfy beds great staff Super location .  Room very small and no bath.  Nice lobby bar and restaurant .  Furniture is a bit old .  Good location and helpful staff .  The bedroom was tight and very small They explain that it because the Hotel has been built on old family residence .  To be near to the main train station.  Small room but fine for a short stay.  Great location.  Have stayed at your hotel earlier Got a much better room then Old small room this time The price was high for the standard .  The location is super .  Only downfall was that we ordered room service late at night and had to pay with cash upfront and the lady had no change to give us Maybe this practice is more universal in UK but usually when I stay in hotels the room service is always paid for when checking out Also if this was part of their policy it should have been made clear to us on arrival or when placing our order for room service .  The location is perfect very easy to get to from the tube and only a 5 minute walk to the Tower of London and Tower Bridge For anyone doing the Hop on Hop off Bus Tours there is a pick up point just in front of the Tower of London The hotel itself is simply beautiful staff were very friendly and helpful the food in the restaurant was lovely and the room was clean and beautifully designed We were given a complimentary upgrade to a Deluxe King which we were delighted it Also because the main elevator was under going maintainable the hotel kindly gave us both a complimentary drink of our choice from the bar to express their sincerest apology Overall I was very impressed and would highly recommend The Chamberlain Hotel to anyone visiting London .  Noisy and capricieuse room the most expansive one could have been a bit more special Not sure it s worth taking the most expansive room .  Breakfast staff.  Heating problems in the room. No Positive. No Negative.  Large comfortable room Good breakfast. No Negative.  Friendly helpful staff at the reception desk . No Negative.  A great place to crash overnight before early morning train.  Nothing .  We were delighted with our stay at 7 Eiffel We were upgraded at no charge on our arrival and the staff were very helpful and friendly The location is fantastic a few minutes from the Metro and Eiffel Tower The hotel is styled in a modern way but with lots of personality Very much recommended .  Breakfast room can be crowded at weekends and food bar was a bit cramped .  The location perfect for airport bus close to metro tram and bus stops 15 mins walk from most attractions Comfortable and quiet Lovely staff friendly helpful Bobby at front desk went out of his way to help breakfast staff always friendly and helpful.  They changed my room to other hotel. No Positive.  1 The air conditioning in the bedroom was regrettably inefficient with it seeming impossible to cool the room down 2 Having a shower curtain over the bath is awful as it wraps itself around you when showering In this day and age a glass screen would be expected or preferably just a good walk in shower rather than a bath Baths use far more water and older people struggle to climb in and out this cannot be safe 3 When there is a function above the breakfast room the staff are stretched and are not available to re fill the food trays or drinks containers 4 Unfortunately the bedroom carpet and decor in the bedroom lobby rm 705 was very worn I think a refit is due 5 Having paid for my room prior to arrival I found it unnecessary for the receptionist to insist on taking my card details again when I wished to pay for any incidentals with cash which I did anyway This came across as very distrusting especially when the receptionist asked if my card would cover the payment for the room and the payment had left my account weeks before 6 We asked for a double bed and were offered either a queen bed or two singles made up as a king size We chose the later hoping it would be bigger but discovered the beds were made up separately and just pushed together .  The hotel has a good contemporary feel is very clean the staff are friendly for a London hotel and we found it well situated for our needs . No Negative.  Fantastic staff and service Beautiful hotel.  The hotel itself is not in a very interesting or lively area.  Comfortable bed pleasant staff and many nice amenities The room was quiet and clean and the city center fairly easily accessible by metro .  Fairly bland business hotel but excellent value and location .  Excellent location close to both the gares de Lyon and Bercy and the lovely Bercy Park and the Bercy village with plenty of lively restaurants and bars Very good breakfast Helpful staff .  Breakfast room too crowded.  Location in the heart of the city center 2mn wal from the Duomo Swimming pool but very cold water Beautiful terrace in the room. No Negative.  The breakfeast is amazingly good .  The only thing which we did not like was the humidity spots in the rooms bathrooms general hotel area with partially already wholes bad smell mushrooms We had 2 rooms in the 3rd floor that does not fit with a price per night of 200 Euros This generally did not match to the rest of the amazing hotel .  Amazing hotel in quite central location beautiful garden nice breakfast room great breakfast generally very cosy nice style.  Need to wait for half an hour to organise parking . No Positive.  extremely poor wifi old towels that desperately need to be replaced.  excellent location delicious breakfast in a quiet and green courtyard.  The location is perfect for Camp Nou and an FC Barcelona game although it might be noisy and chaotic on game days I assume because there were no games while I stayed Otherwise it is far from the centre but public transportation is very good accessible and takes you there in 30 minutes walk metro The main attractions in Barcelona are far from each other anyway so there is no perfect location .  Everything but especially the great price with breakfast and extra bed for our daughter included Comfy bed good breakfast large and clean bedroom very friendly staff who was extremely efficient in solving small issues we had e g there was initially no extra bed in the room even if we specifically asked for this and the hotel replied with a confirmation beforehand but once notified they solved it quickly calling a taxi I suppose the location is very good if you want to attend a FC Barcelona game .  there is just nothing to do around the hotel in the evening . No Positive. No Negative.  Fantastik location beautiful room and very kind staff.  The rooftop was closed for a private party .  Nice location wonderful garden relaxed atmosphere good restaurant . No Negative.  Location was perfect staff very efficient all in all an excellent stay.  if only they could make a decent cup of coffee .  What you see is what you get Very hip . No Negative.  As always I love the location proximity to Duomo good value for money.  Tight squeeze in a tiny room Didn t deserve the description deluxe No lift and a narrow stairway to negotiate with luggage aim to sleep ground floor .  Location excellent for walking access to Oxford and Bond Streets and other central locations .  Nothing .  Hi hotel located in very convenient place 5min walk from Pl Catalonia Stylish comfortable rooms are big enough comparing to other Barcelona hotels Really very happy and would stay here again Good internet You can find a lot places for breakfast around the corner .  Curtains broken even Engineer couldn t fix Television broken due to ill fitting broken cable chord Rooms now look tired.  Bed is fine.  The elevators are so slow that you have to really need them physical reasons .  Nice clean.  If you are going to charge to eat breakfast at the restaurant in the hotel you should at least provide a decent discount for the hotel guests We only ate dinner at the oa one time It wasn t bad but not worth the price It would have been nice to have the option to eat breakfast for a decent price for two people and or a family Or even a complementary coffee per adult would have been nice The parking was overpriced also .  Convenient location clean room comfortable bed .  Unfriendly staff.  The furniture.  Fridge in room No minibar and couldn t understand the point of the fridge.  Bed was comfortable but too small for me was only a double like king size.  Room 424 was a little dated maybe Wasn t what I was expecting for a superior room in a 5 star hotel small but was clean and ok for one night Bed was a bit hard but no great problem.  Excellent staff beautiful pool great location Would definitely stay here again .  Room a little tight but no deal breaker.  Fridge in room Two chairs Big tv Air con Comfortable bed Decent sized shower Location.  Room smaller than expected No bottled water.  Central position.  They have two types of room one type is modern decorated which are decent and new rooms and everything is good in it and the other type are the ones which are from the time that hotel is opened and for sure are old ones with old bathroom .  Staffs are polite and breakfast is very good . No Negative.  Location room staff were excellent. No Negative.  Location.  Only thing was having no bath But you can live with that because of the wet room you have with a large waterfall shower .  Hotel staff where friendly room service was excellent the view of the tower was amazing from room Short walk to most places was great The bed was so comfy bedroom really stylish Docking station to listen to music was a bonus and built in plugs for your UK electrics so we did not need a adapter Super cool .  Probably the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in Just about fitted a double bed The wardrobe was completely useless no room to hang anything above the kettle and minibar .  A pleasant hotel in an excellent location A decent bed and shower .  Breakfast started at 8 and we went down at about 9 I would say the bread had been put out for this time as it was hard needed to be covered .  Room was comfy overall breakfast was good and excellent location for shows in Wembley . No Negative.  spacious lobby nice design friendly staff plenty of small shops around 3mins walk to the Tube. No Negative.  Location room breakfast all this stuff was the most satisfying .  I think things like breakfast Wi Fi in rooms and parking could be thrown in to the room price really It sort of goes with the whole point of staying at a hotel .  Location pool deck views comfy room bathroom breakfast was superb too .  Difficulties to communicate with some staff as little English spoken Long wait at breakfast hotel seemed unorganised and chaotic .  Bed lovely and comfy great location . No Negative.  Great location Nearby the London Tube London Tower and Tower Bridge Breakfast was good and I m happy we got it included in our room rate .  old and dirty room .  the breakfast area only .  Nothing.  View of train station and great location.  Room was quite dark some of the lights did not work .  Spacious comfortable room . No Negative.  The mini bar was free and got restocked and the staff were always happy to help .  Because it is so central hotel was a little noisy at times but ear plugs thoughtfully provided .  Terrific staff always helpful and ready to assist with any enquiry The hotel is really centrally placed just across from a tram stop and close to restaurants and shops .  Nothing.  Modern spacious and clean room Friendly staff .  Breakfasts very expensive at 18 . No Positive.  Very Noisy.  Good breakfast good staff Clean comfortable.  Everything was fine .  Excellent location so convenient for British Museum tube buses St Pancras restaurants cafes supermarket cinema shops etc Very helpful swift staff I ve stayed here several times now and will return .  The room is always too hot thank God for the fan and kitchen smells came up through the window in the morning Big hole in curtain and no fridge no luggage rack But really no reasons not to stay there .  Our request for a quiet garden room was met and it was lovely and quiet And it s a rather spacious room for London Very helpful staff great location nice atmosphere Will be back . No Negative.  Little far from city centre but great tram system.  Nothing.  The hotel is just perfect.  There was nothing that we did not like about this beautiful clean hotel .  We got upgraded to a room with a balcony and a view the Eiffel Tower Variety of breakfast options Staff very polite and obliging .  Nothing.  Everything.  I didn t appreciate the 3 small cockroaches in my bathroom .  Bed was very comfortable check in quick and the room was a good size . No Negative.  Standard room was a very good size for London Staff were extremely friendly and welcoming Beds were very comfortable and the Elemis products were great Free Nespresso pods with machine and take away cups a great idea in the room Pool and sauna area were very relaxing .  They had gave me the wrong room I had then asked to change my room they then said that none was available except emperor suite Then went on to tell me that I would have to pay more if I want to move my room I explained out of good will I shouldn t have to pay because they had messed up my booking already For the rest of my stay here I was stressed and couldn t relaxed I was upset and disappointed as I had booked this hotel to celebrated my boyfriends 26th Staff was rude wasn t helpful at all door handle on the bathroom door was broken there was a nail sticking out of the wall where the desk was Unstable chairs for the dinner table in my room I had taken pictures and I will be emailing HR about this Wasn t worth the headache or money spent not a 5 hotel.  Breakfast.  The staff.  The location. No Negative.  Man at the entrance was excellent entertained my son whilst I checked in All staff very helpful and friendly Breakfast very yummy And overall excellent stay would love to come again .  Decor is very tired and warn out Breakfast was poor quality for a 5 star hotel Too few staff to serve breakfast as well .  Location and front desk staff.  Well I first booked a single room That room was too small had no desk and it was very noisy street noise were beyond imagination So I asked the hotel staff to locate me to another room so the did after the manager approval to a double room Which I think was a positive gesture of them .  The double room are generally ok except the one in the basement as it is very close to the kitchen Their breakfast is very good perfectly cooked eggs fresh veggies and other stuff The staff are really friendly and the hotel location is perfect very close to goodge station Oxford st and the London school .  Nothing.  All fine .  TV programs were limited Internet limited to 2 persons only .  Location was near green park station Sainsbury M S and Tesco exclusive shop brands and tourist sites Double beds were comfortable and spacious Taxis easy to get Reception and concierge staff friendly and helpful .  Information staff gave us was often misleading .  Great location Quite spacious as for Paris and comfortable room Cosy lobby Very calm all the rooms face the inner court .  Being bumped to another hotel with no advance notice .  Got bumped from here to their sister hotel on Finsbury Square which was annoying as my party venue was the Brewery but they provided courtesy transport between the hotels and a complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience so it all worked out OK.  No free parking paid a fortune to park my car.  Close to centre. No Negative.  Staff were very attentive to the needs of my elderly Aunt . No Negative.  Absolutely LOVED my stay here I m from the UK and took my husband away for a surprise weekend in Amsterdam the room was so big the beds were really comfortable my husband wanted to know what kind of pillows they had as he even wanted to buy his own Were a young couple aged 25 27 it was in a great location as the hotel was a short walk from a tram stop which took you into city center with the help of google maps we got around incredibly easily with a 24 hour tram pass bought from the hotel we were able to get around the city with ease .  Nothing crazy just a pretty standard hotel .  Great location and very friendly staff .  Parking was a little confusing and very tight getting in .  Very clean staff very friendly Lovely treat for my wife as hotel was luxurious I stay in hotels 3 4 nights a week so I know cleanliness and standards .  Nothing .

I stayed there the night before my wedding and the staff were friendly and let us check out later as I was getting ready for the big day in the room . No Negative.  centrally located all major sites at walkable distance good staff.  The house keeping can do a better job.  The Staff and location.  In a location close to the station with lots of hotels Large groups of people hanging around station and immediate local streets with high armed police and miltary presence creating an air of unease Preferred location of an earlier hotel located nearer the central city and away from the station .  Professional staff and sound accommodation. No Negative.  Hotels location is fantastic We really enjoyed our stay the staff were always very pleasant and helpful We would definitely stay there again and recommend to other s .  Nothing rest as you would expect for this level of hotel.  Staff helpful Excellent location.  bed spread was torn and the room wasn t cleaned very well during our stay Overheard manager telling off the bartender for letting us pay cash instead of charging to room said we would spend more if charging to the room Very rude staff .  location was good as was the cocktail bar.

Every thing.  Nothing. No Negative.  The room was very clean quiet and comfortable with the added bonus of a perfect view of Tower Bridge We would highly recommend this hotel . No Negative.  Everything was amazing Room was perfect.  Nothing.  The location.  I was sadly disappointed with the air conditioning as the room was rather stifling I hate to leave any complaint as I loved my stay but it did make it difficult to sleep at night and we had to prop the door open to get some cooler air whilst getting ready the following morning .  Upon entering this hotel you will be struck by how fabulous the decor of this place is Several swish self serve check in machines are available with plenty of staff on hand incase you need any assistance Take the beautiful spiral staircase or the lift the choice is yours upstairs and with just one tap of your key card yep no faffing you will be in your room in no time Once inside you will be greeted with lovely personalised touches such as your name to welcome you on the mood pad as well as on the huge flatscreen tv The moodpad is really fun enabling you to choose and change the lighting colour control the blackout blinds change tv channels and select movies you will have everything you need at your fingertips allowing you more time to luxuriate in the spacious and comfortable beds Another fab perk of citizenM is the fridge all of the contents are free Ours contained a lovely selection of cold drinks two bottles of water and several fruit juices including Rooibos tea with passionfruit These rooms are also soundproofed and we were completey undisturbed by any noise during our stay which was a real delight With many attractions on the doorstep such as Shakespeare s Globe a mere four minutes walk away and The Shard being visible from the street below I would most definitely stay here again a true gem .  The hotel was a bit dated could do with a refurbishment .  Good location price upgraded on arrival and deal on breakfast very clean was a bit worried when we read the reviews but that was unfounded.  Unfortunately my daughter suffers with claustrophobia so she found the breakfast tables rather tight but the staff soon addressed it .  We were very impressed with the hotel Staff were attentive Nothing too much trouble for them even in breakfast my daughter who suffers with claustrophobia the staff found us a different table .  The room was tiny and so was the shower Overall not much comfort here e g not enough space to keep the luggage for the price we paid.  Staff were very friendly and polite We were on our honeymoon and they even offered a small complimentary bottle of champagne The location is excellent.  That my stay wasn t longer .  A fresh and clean feel .  The towels we ad were getting ready to be replaced with newer ones .  Helpful staff across the board Comfy beds with very clean white linen.  No atmosphere very bland hotel restaurant never looked open and staff mainly hung around the front entrance and didn t look properly trained or managed more interested in playing on phones than saying hello swimming pool cold.  Close to everything can walk to most attractions. No Negative.  the location.  A bit off the beaten track.  Fantastic view from 26th floor.  they did not refill the coffee and the mini bar on a regular bases .  Location is excellent and the staff is overall friendly specially the bar tender downstair .  Milk provided with coffee was out of date and bathroom is quite small.  Close to centre of town.  I had to leave after one day for health reasons and did not get a refund although I am paying for 4 nights Moreover I requested a room for two adults and a toddler so I asked then to add a small comf bed to a double bed room but they did not agree plus the hotel has no parking . No Positive.  The room is very small but also not comfortable and available amenities do not match 4star European standard We found live ants in the room or ants found us .  Perfect location meters from metro and bus station in a middle of the old city and walking distance from many attractions.  The swimming pool was a little cold .  Everything what a great hotel and experience. No Negative.  The hotel was well presented and comfortable The hotel s location is excellent within 5 mins walk of the Eiffel Tower and plenty of good restaurants The staff were very polite and helpful Many thanks .  Not central but was ok.  Twice daily cleaning nice staff cool bar with fireplace . No Negative.  This hotel is fantastic A great location staff were brilliant and the room was lovely and spacious .  Room much smaller than the impression given by the photographs Breakfast pricey at 19 5 euros Smelly drain in bathroom on first night Cleared up after that .  Staff were very helpful and friendly Very good location.  I ve stayed at this property 3 times in the past 2 years and the staff at the check in counter are generally unfriendly and dismissive On this trip as usual I had a lousy experience during check in unhelpful and sarcastic when I had questions staff s name was Roy I was placed in a very small room on the first floor much smaller than the previous times I ve stayed here and after a while there was a really bad sewage smell from the toilet When I called to tell them the problem there was no investigation or effort on their part to check what s wrong with the room and while I appreciate that they accepted my request to switch rooms it seemed like they already knew the problem with this room Plus the 2nd room I d gotten was much bigger the usual size as my previous stays I hope the property can look into the problem and NOT place guests in there if you know the room is unfit for guests The difference in size in the room is also ridiculous considering guests pay the same amount for the same room type . No Positive.  Gym could be bigger.  Melon was and should always be available at breakfast. No Negative.  All staff were very happy very friendly and very helpful.  rooms were small its far away from downtown in morning things are ok but in evening its difficult to find anything for u.  everything was clean i have car so no big problem .

Bed was too soft and the room was slightly on the small side .  Excellent customer service Great location .  nothing.  Excellent location good value for money great facillities.  We could not order Bloody Marys at breakfast unless we got them from the bar I think that s how it worked .  The staff was amazing They all went above and beyond to be helpful They noticed small things about us and later would bring us something or give information relavent to making our stay in the hotel and city the best it could be We will definitely be staying here again .  Limited tea coffee and fresh milk maybe could have been obtained if we had asked.  Location was great room was upgraded and staff were very friendly.  Building work ongoing and restaurant will not open till September now This was disappointing Refreshments in entrance very good .  Great Location and excellent staff. No Negative.  Great location and very clean and comfortable Perfect for a trip to visit the city as very central Would highly recommend to anyone visiting Barcelona .  Thin walls with size of room meant could hear other guests in corridor and other rooms Nasty scratchy duvet cover with just a sheet in addition .  Good central location for my needs Reasonable price for location Room small but had a good workspace area Helpful staff .  It s somewhat of a maze inside of the hotel once you re on your floor My room had a window but it was very close to a wall No daylight .  Nice staff concierge to carry your bags Room was pretty nice bed storage for clothes mini bar multimedia tv alarm clock with dock for smartphone Small but clean bathroom with bathtub shower in tub toilet sink large mirror Lots of power outlets including HMDI port USB 5v port .  STAFF VERY YOUNG AND UNEXPERT.  FOOD LOCATION COMFORT.  Had to wait for 30mins for bottle opener tone delivered to room then member of staff came opened bottle of wine for me then went away with bottle opener Had to call down to reception ask if they could leave one in room my daughters too was the same Room just didn t seem to be organised with basic items had to wait 25 30 mins for eggs Benedict to be made at breakfast service is very poor .  Near o2 venue.  Sound proofing in room 507 was absolutely appalling This room should not be allowed to be let Plus very unsecure with a flimsy wooden door separating the two rooms .  The location and price.  Room size is ok but not big location is walking distance to metro st and thames bridge maybe it is little bit expensive in comparison to other EU capitals.  New hotel clean bar is nice comfortable bad breakfast is ok. No Negative.  Best Location Best service Best at all .  Air fun too noisy poor but funny breakfast.  Position atmosphere people.

Location is very central Very modern room .  Getting a little run down and breakfast was pricey .  Location.  I wasn t able to use the sauna when I wanted to because no one was around to turn it on .  Great location Half way between the tourist are and the non tourist area .  Bed was crackling Not so near to the center of Vienna Breakfast came out 30 later than the hotel s time schedule so we had to wait and change our travel time schedule .  Breakfast was great Clean .  Everything was great .  The staff were absolutely wonderful and helped us out when my husband and I both got sick They changed the sheets upon request as we both had a fever and called a doctor to come and visit us at the Hotel The standard of the d cor and the service of the staff make this a great place to stay The view of the Eiffel Tower from our room was perfect Thank you Hotel Brighton .  Nothing.  The service provided by the staff was fantastic every request was dealt with very well.  The room was smaller than appeared in the picture SPA was under construction Device at the pool very slow.  The staff wS friendly location is very good Everywhere was clean.  The room wasnt ready till exactly 2 30 and was promised 2 00. No Positive.  I booked a grand twin room whose size was recorded as 28 square meters In fact the room looked very small and the size was like 20 square meters Maybe a structure problem or anything else I asked a high floor with nice view at reservation with 3 nights but found the assignment in a completely opposite way It was totally out of my expectation with a high price room reservation The room also had a shower drain problem I do not recommend a grand twin room at least for a family .  A staff was impressively kind and he tried to help me with a smile at every moment unlike two female staffs . No Negative.  everything is perfect in mandarin orental Barcelona .  They charged for room before we got there as we were paying cash on arrival So had to wait for money to be transferred back into account which was annoying as money was there in account for spending so was left short on my stay .  Location was perfect .  Slightly too American on arrival I would have expected porters to be around and for someone to show you to your room.  Very comfortable room.  Bed was not long enough for my 6foot 3 inch brother in law .  Lovely atmosphere dressed up for Christmas helpful staff at reception and in the restaurant good choice at breakfast Would recommend .

There was only one packet of biscuits in a double room for two guests Ideally there should be two .  The hotel was clean modern and the staff were friendly and always willing to help with even the most minor of requests .  Only one bed for 3 of us duvet covers were covered in dust and smelled.  Staff were lovely location was great.  Bathroom is small but workable.  Great location close to many beatiful shops and subway station.  Difficult to navigate within the hotel The pillows could probably do part time job as a brick . No Positive.  Nothing .  Second stay here lovely hotel area so easy to travel to west end theatres and sightseeing The staff on reception Kristine and Maria are the nicest ladies I have met in any hotel .  Only had one person on reception who was trying to do 4 things at once so took a while to get checked in.  Food was delicious room service and breakfast presented beautifully.  Breakfast was a bit lack lustre The hot food was lukewarm and there was a 12 5 service charge it was a self service buffet .  Friendly staff decent sized room and comfy bed The staff changed our room when the one originally allocated had no mobile phone reception We ended up with a larger room with a view so we were happy .  The tram runs beside the hotel and is noisy The air conditioner in our room did not work properly .

Pretty much everything we had a great stay .  Our room was in the basement right on a very noisy road traffic and people hardly slept at all Heating not working either in 2 of the 3 rooms we booked Also the location says South Kensington but it is NOT South Ken its Earls Court.  The staff were excellent and moved us to a much quieter room for the next night.  Nothing .

It was close to the places we were visiting so it was very convenient.  The food was a bit expensive for the quality it was .

The Bar late night i thought was not giving the Hotel residents any special priority for a table Plus we did not find the bar very relaxing for late night drink .  Overall the Langham is lovely hotel but one would expect this for 5Star Hotel .  Beds were a bit hard.  Close to station nice facilities Helpful staff.  Rooms facing the front of the building can be noisy at night the hotel is on quite a busy road you get a lot of traffic even late at night Would pay extra stay in a room on the other side of the hotel .

Max only 2 people in a room.  The room was lovely it was very comforting and I had booked the hotel room for my birthday night and it was a very great stay .  Location is very old not invested in past years at some time this hotel must have seen glory but today it badly needs renovation AC was not working on a day of 40 deg in Paris one can imagine .  Location is central accessible by train parking is a challenge .  The pillows were a little too hard on the bed.  The location and ease to get to the O2 was great.

The bed . No Negative.  When we got there we were offered an upgrade to a suite lovely room staff were all polite we always stay at the marriot county hall not any more this hotel is streets ahead and better value for money and ideal for theatre visits.

Close to Drury Lane British Museum and some very nice restaurants Good Breakfast Very pleasant staff Clean rooms I would use this hotel again .  The general hubbub of the Square is bearable and the ear plugs help But on one of our nights the beating of drums in the square at 2am hard to turn a deaf ear to would have had Rembrandt turning over in his grave .  29th May 1st June A character hotel on Rembrandt Square where you can feel the throbbing vibrant heartbeat of Amsterdam City It is very centrally located from where you can either meander round the canals or wander off to some of the major sites Royal Palace Dam Square Anne Frank s House Old Church Rembrandt s House Rijksmuseum We had a lovely room on the 6th Floor with great views over the Square and City Thank you to the staff at RH Schiller for making it a very memorable holiday for us .  the room very small.  location clean service.  I got a rash from the bed sheets maybe I am more sensitive or allergic to their washing gel or I dont know where s the problem And maybe the rooms could smell good .  Breakfast was totally incredible it was really delicious and we couldn t barely go how we were always full the hotel is near subway station Alser Strasse maybe about 5minutes by walk swimming pool was warm and clean and after hard day it was the best thing to do I really enjoyed my trip to Vienna and I want to thank to the whole Exe Vienna Hotel if I go to Vienna again I ll come back I promise .

The staff were very helpful and extreamly funny too. No Negative.  Everything was to the highest possible quality We have a new favourite hotel .  Light sleepers be aware metro makes rumbling noise when it passes we were on the second floor Price Quality was rather poor for a 120 Euro day price you would expect some more room and comfort although it could be the additional city tax The rooms are a bit dated There are smoking and non smoking rooms be aware of this when booking We were non smokers and got a room that smelled from years of smoking .  Location was excellent close to the metro station Lima station red line from where you can explore the entire city Nice breakfast area Clean rooms Nice spa area with showers sauna and small swimming pool.  The first night we were in a room where the air conditioning was not working and could not be fixed The second night we were moved to another room on the top floor with a great view but the bathroom smelled very strongly of cigarette smoke and there was a room opposite which was constantly being used by cleaning staff so it was quite noisy I think we were just quite unlucky though the housekeeping staff might have noticed the smell in the bathroom .  Great location for central London Staff were lovely and very helpful Beds comfortable and bedrooms well appointed .  Evening meal menu was a bit limited .  Excellent service Clean Friendly staff Good location .  Minor really but at Breakfast I did ask for poached eggs on brown bread but I got poached eggs that were not cooked and on white bread just a note to the chef to be a little more careful but the staff were great in the restaurant and so it didn t deter from my enjoyment.  Great staff great location and really lovely decor .  Staff just need to be a little bit more hospitable. No Positive.  Bathroom not prestine clean.  Location staff quiet good for the money large enough room .

Large bed Separate bath and shower I loved Good views Breakfast was amazing with views over canary wharf Spa facilities were lovely Being right next to the O2 was great for us as we were seeing a show there Lots of parking easier than getting the train .  Reception staff we dealt with were a bit dour On booking in our receptionist seemed unsure for what exactly she was reading on her screen but we felt this was really down to the language barrier .  Managers and bar restaurant staff were very friendly and efficient Bedrooms very comfortable clean and great bathroom Breakfast very good .  Nothing.

Small building points such as the sink pretty design but No real space for putting toiletries Shower great but water dropped out when door opened Rug had to be turned back to open wardrobe and finally bedroom mirror fixed and hard to use even when sitting unless you were a tall lady Small points We were very comfortable and will recommend it .  Spacious room quiet lovely huge comfy bed loads of mirrors red hot water .  Could hear corridor noise but it wasn t constant so didn t bother us In reality I ve heard noise from corridors in every hotel I ve stayed in .  Very nice room and massive bed Close to tube station .  I don t like the staffs.  I like the location of hotel.  I paid over 400 euros for a boxy badly designed room You couldn t see the tv from the sofa The cava they gave complimentary was undrinkable Better to not offer anything than give a 5 euro bottle The pool was thick with chlorine which burned your eyes Altogether not a good hotel .  Nothing.  It is kind of expensive .  Our rooms two rooms with a dining area were comfortable The location is good walking distance to most of the places We have a tiny kitchen and dining table outside of the room It is convenient to have a coffee or something in the room .  Shower cubicle was dirty and moldy didn t like being in a basement room with a brick wall for a view.  Good location front desk staff friendly helpful.  IT is simply the worst hotel ever Had to check out after a few hours On top of that was charged at the hotel as well as via booking com I want a refund The manager gave me a mouth full and told I was an idiot etc etc No ONE should say anything wrong about his hotel he said I was lost for words Checked in a Four Seasons afterwards Only reason for booking the hotel was that it was close to the Expo I was attending What a Cardinal mistake .

I had a diner at Steak the grill restaurant Pricing is just a joke even if we are in a 5 stars Hotel 55 for a 350 gr angus steak and then you have to pay for some aded vegetables The service in this place was 50 50 Breakfast also was a kind of industrial conventional food .  The roof bar is a real place to be From cocktail to atmosphere from service to music everything is perfect My room was very nice too A bit too cold 2 senses Very good place to spend time lower level for Food issues .  3rd floor no elevator as usual in these old London buildings The Internet was useless had to log in every few minutes only 3 coat hangers seriously .

Location is amazing Staff were very friendly and accommodating Stayed with a group of friends and gf Room was quirky modern and very clean A .  We were on the 3rd floor and there was no lift which I had not realised on booking . No Positive.  Air conditioner was noisy and I could not get it turned off.  Location was fantastic room was good value and we enjoyed our stay .  It doesn t give a 4 star feeling The place is cheap looking and could use a renovation You can hear it when people come and leave The bathroom has no lock and the door is cheap It s so small too One of our rooms didn t lock properly and you had to really make sure it clicked or else it wouldn t lock The room is super small They call it a twin but the two beds are right by each other as if it s one bed There s no room between the beds Even movement is hard when there s two people in the room because of the tights space between the tv area and the foot of the two beds I don t think I d ever stay there if it weren t for the location and for it being cheaper than Park Tower I hate staying there to be honest it s uncomfortable But I stayed there before and if they continue having better prices I might stay again .  Staff were friendly and polite Location close to shopping and some great restaurants .  The view outside the window .  The welcome drink sweet offered Very close to center very clean tidy Polite staff Near to metro Tram .  not at all satisfied I won t book again this hotel the room was really small even if i have booked a superior room I have asked information regarding gatwick express and the staff at the concierge told me to check the web site since it was not their duty to provide information .  the location is great perfect position in a wonderful area . No Negative.  Lovely hotel Staff very friendly great location.  Service charge at the bar Service charge in restaurant acceptable but for 2 drinks whilst sitting at the bar not so .  Staff very friendly and helpful We were made most welcome .  the elevators took forever to come housekeeping weren t really cleaning they just changed sheets and towels but cleaning NO my toilet was not cleaned even every other day they just put TP shampoo and stuff but didn t clean.  the staff is so hospitable 0.  A lot of mosquitos in the room Don t know how they got in as it is winter and the windows was always closed There was a lot of dust on the top of the bed .  Bed was comfortable and room had a lot of space Breakfast is also nice not a lot of variety but good enough to get you going in the morning The reception man was super friendly .  The hotel is tired and outdated in terms of decor Staff although efficient showed very little interest in my complaint of a bad nights sleep for my two year old son as we were put in a room right next to a housekeeping closet and entry and exit to this room happened until late into the evening The room itself felt rather dirty the carpet should be replaced or burnt It was filthy The bathrooms fittings were very old there was rust a cracked basin pock marked bath and the entire room felt generally unclean and certainly unpolished Very disappointing stay It seems the hotel relies on regular patronage from the Olympias exhibition centre as well as numerous airline staff and as they are still getting bookings they have made no effort to update the rooms or hotel decor in anyway .  Nothing .  Just didn t like the breakfast food menu.  Everything was fabulous . No Negative.  Modern and stylish but yet atmospheric hotel with imaginatively decorated rooms and common area The hotel is located next to the main railway station You can easily reach the city centre by tram D which has its terminus right outside the hotel The rooms are clean well equipped and comfortable and the staff is friendly and helpful Luggage room with lockers Don t miss the buffet breakfast that is great value for money Definitely a good place to stay in Vienna .  Noise. No Positive.  The furnishings were worn the lighting was poor and the in room safe was broken The phone message light was malfunctioning and the shower angle couldn t be adjusted Internet was not free .

Flight was delayed due to Delta computer glitches Asked hotel to change to another night They were inflexible . No Positive.  Bar prices very expensive.  Very nice central hotel staff all very attentive Very comfortable will use again in future.  The air con should still be adjustable in winter.  The breakfast was excellent and the staff were very helpful The aircon in the room we were staying in wouldn t adjust below 20 degrees I asked if we could be moved room and this was done without any hesitation We were moved to an even room with a terrace .  Nothing.  Very clean and modern hotel Very luxurious.  Nothing.  Wow great hotel food excellent every mod con you could think off great spa and good location.  .

Efficient distantly friendly staff quiet room excellent location especially if you are traveling by Eurostar good underground connections room was very comfortable but had only the basic toiletery amenities which was just fine I will deffinitely stay there again.  The pub was too close so too easy to drink too much haha.  The Staff were delightful and spoke slow french so I could understand They were overly helpful and even upgraded us The location is perfect the seine to one side and the small cobble locked streets of st michel to the other The decor was beautiful relaxed like an old wooden cottage in the middle of nowhere Incredible Home in the middle of Paris . No Negative.  Brilliant Hotel brilliant location.  Room was not as nice as first visit smaller and smelly .  Loved the breakfast. No Negative.  Nice size room Nice to have decent size fridge.  the hotel is simply very outdated as in everything the outside looks modern the inside with everything looks like 20 years old could not get the heating to work at all it needs urgent up to date furnishings .  nice staff clean room location. No Negative.  Amazing view across the city from the room Rooms modern and luxurious Hotel staff accommodating and friendly .  Room a bit small for two big tall people . No Positive.  Wifi tends to be slow at night No iron boards available in the room Nothing else .  Friendly staff spacious executive room spacious bathroom The room is very clean they tend to clean the room every time we leave the hotel The balcony is amazing The location is excellent jus a few minutes away from the shopping area We enjoyed our stay there Thank you The Square Team .  I always use booking com to book hotels and rooms but somehow the Hilton did not have my booking and I had to chase it up several times Very distressful Although in the end I had an amazing experience it would be better if the room had a fridge to store drinks and snacks and it is very silly to be paying wifi at a four star hotel .  I had an amazing night at the double tree in the docklands The room was very clean and beautiful with a balcony Staff were very friendly who generously upgraded my room with a kingsize bed A great thing is you get free unlimited rides on the ferry to canary wharf from the hotel A beautiful couples experience would definitely come back .  The family tried to swim in the pool after it open but not only was the pool super tiny but when we swim apparently water were going over the side glass and down 7 floors below on to people trying to have breakfast so we were told to try not to make any splashes until at least for another hour Note we were just swimming and not playing water fight or anything That I believe is a design fault the glass should be higher Everyone around the pool ended up just staring at it for fear we get water on someone s head and we never went back Another small incident also on the first days of our stay was a housekeeper walked in without knocking while I was changing and it happened to both rooms Could have at least knock .  Stayed 7 nights Staff were excellent i e Aleksi Ecaudo Godson etc were always there to help Anticipate client s needs without even us asking From smooth check in to proactively telling us what is around the hotel area wifi and being very well verse in restaurant recommendations and reservations directions etc always with a smile Rooms were clean things were refill Things were organized and we have all the necessity require Overall Staff was the thing that will get me to come back again .  Bathroom a little bit old fashioned .  Perfect place to stay good location Clean and calm .  Again minor fault floor was uneven but that s only due to age of building.  To be really picky the lift is really narrow could only fit 1 adult and suitcase at 1 time .  Too hot in the room Couldn t control the temperature.  Responsiveness and friendlyness of staff. No Negative.  Location was great Room was surprisingly spacious Staff were helpful .  I think the food could have been better .  The staff were great And the room was very clean . No Negative.  The Best breakfast in Europe Superb Delicius food . No Negative.  Very friendly and professional staff Could not fault anything as a self confessed perfectionist that is saying something Ideally positioned Would not hesitate to stay there again .  Room size was very small No bar facilities for residents after 11pm.  Location.  The furniture of the lobby is old and the bed is not too much soft .  I liked the cooperation of the staff and the cleanliness of the hotel and the breakfast .  poor breakfast. No Positive.  The room could have been cleaner dust was noticeable .  The hotel had free parking on site .  N A.  Everything .  Hated the fact that there was a lot of construction noise from 8 20am on both Friday and Saturday I appreciate that this would happen in the week but was very disappointed and annoyed to be awoken on the weekend Due to this I thought the room was extremely overpriced .  The bedroom facilities and hotel in general .  Outside area to sit.  All staff friendly and efficient Good value for money Well placed for travel to City centre as well as airport. No Negative.  Location is excellent for Portobello Market and Hyde Park .  Nothing.  All Excellent.  The hotel assumed that our late check in meant we weren t going to stay at the hotel and gave our room away even though we had pre paid We turned up at 11pm and didn t get a replacement room sorted until 12 30am The room we were given only had 1 double bed although we d paid for 2 and were given 2 camp beds to accomodate all members of the group Not what we had paid for After distress plenty of phone calls to reception we were refunded 50 as half of our party did not recieve what they had paid for a king size bed .  Our complimentary breakfast was lovely a great selection of pastries fruit and the option for a cooked breakfast also Lovely bedroom king size bed was very comfy camp beds ok Good location across the road from Edgware Road tube station or a short walk to Paddington station Staff quite slow to react rectify situation but did apologise compensate for poor service.  Lift not working properly could have been an issue for my elderly parents Small room but adequate Full size basin in the en suite would have been good.  Good location ideal for the Albert Hall Friendly staff Good Buffet Breakfast. No Negative.  I liked everything about the hotel but I especially enjoying the little cafe The cappuccino was delicious . No Negative.  The staff especially on the reception desk were extremly helpful The room was very quiet clean and the bed comfortable Location was important to us as we were in Milan for a short visit and we wanted to expierence all that the city had to offer .  All was good except everything was old dire need of renovation. No Positive.  Double rooms were all occupied so had to check in a room with two twin single beds but was fine anyway .  Nice Staff Location near underground station. No Negative.  Friendly staff although the room is a bit small it it is clean and cozy The location is a big big plus .  Terrible coffee Rude breakfast host. No Positive.  The room was ridiculously small. No Positive.  For one week the bed sheets were never changed room floors are never wiped they do not clean the room bathrooms Even when told many times House keeping were terrible .  Location and breakfast.  They need a concierge Staff was nice but didn t have a great grasp of public transportation options .  Very comfortable bed outstanding location nice upscale contemporary decor good towels great shower free water bottle Very nice breakfast IF included in room price . No Negative.  Parking is a bit of a chore but the location of the rail tube links excellent .  the room.  Location.  no baby coat despite I got the confirmation by phone call few days before .  location.  Only minor problem was the lock in our bathroom door didn t work But that s just our room .  Perfect location Very clean hotel Staff are very friendly and helped us with train information and arranged a car to take us to Venice I recommend anyone who wants to visit Milan to stay here .  The staff around the pool and the pool restaurant did nothing to manage some very obnoxious children and teenagers in the pool We literally couldn t even sit in our son chairs and get some sun because these children super so poorly behaved and were splashing water and other guests The staff clearly should ve manage this and did not The pool area is also very short on lounge chairs and there are too many tables for food and beverage that are just not being used This whole experience really makes the pool area of no value .  Desk staff were very helpful . No Negative.  Elegant yet welcoming hotel in an ideal location steps from the tube direct to Heathrow and minutes from museums or the train stations that can take you onward Very comfortable stay and a lovely staff .  Room very small abit on the claustophobic side Queuing for breakfast which i also thought was over priced . No Positive.  Nothing all good.  Rooms quite spacious for the price in London Staff very friendly and efficient Plenty of choice at breakfast and well organised restaurant given it was quite busy Hotel in very safe area.  I didn t feel safe in the area around the hotel While I realise that isn t the within the hotel s remit it did have affect my overall enjoyment and satisfaction with the stay Value for money you get what you pay for though since coming home I ve realised we were charged more than the booking amount so keep an eye on that .  The staff were all great free wifi excellent shower .  You have to request anything otherwise nothing available in your room .  Just the location .  There was a dripping tap in the sink The shower basin filled up and did not drain easily Some of the switches and electricity plugs were not secure . No Positive. No Negative.  We loved everything about this special and unique hotel The staff are incredibly kind welcoming and professional The hotel is just beautiful Not to be missed if you come to Milan We ll be back .  Too many guests for the size of the facilities Check in was long and chaotic Breakfast had to be served in an adjoining ballroom because there was no more room in the dining room The breakfast in the ballroom felt like an express breakfast at an economy hotel which for the price per night at this hotel was hardly the case .  Charming front veranda and historic charm The staff was very friendly and helpful The location is close to all the main sites and there are always taxis available outside .  For some reason our room smelt of cigarette smoke on returning one day all a bit strange as the hotel has a no smoking policy.  Easy to access from the airport and then only a 15 minute tram ride into Amsterdam.  We have stayed before but were not remembered With a suite even mini complimentary champagne is always nice but not always offered.  the room mini suite was very well laid out and very comfortable The staff were very good at looking after us Sitting on your balcony in the evening is pure Paris.  We were not able to lock the door from inside I asked but they said there is nothing they can do about it The reason being is that the building is old Our room was in the basement I did not feel secure at all Also there were no towels in the room .  Near by Kings Cross station You can pretty much walk to all those tourist spots . No Negative.  Very best view very best location very best staff very very very .  Nothing .  Rooms were excellent breakfast was very good and well presented and finally the staff were very polite and helpful .  poor quality toilet paper.  Good controlled aircon All food and beverage outlets.  It s far from Knightsbridge.  Size of the room was really huge.  I personally liked everything but now and again the paint needs redoing.  The bed was extremely comfortable the room size was great with added bonus of a patio lovely.  Amba hotel need one thing to be excellent It need houze in the bathroom which Muslims people after the bathroom clean their selfs it s important thing.  Amba hotel was very good.  Completely ignored in the outdoor cafe area in spite of it not being a busy time and lots of staff Mad a complaint . No Positive.  Water pressure in the shower a bit low We paid the onsite upgrade of 22 for a move from a superior to a deluxe room yet apart from being moved to the last floor great view the room seemed to be identical to the pictures of the superior one Not worth the extra buck.  Amazing bed good location decent breakfast good staff views of the cities. No Negative.  Everything was perfect Price to quality ratio was unmatched. No Negative.  excelente.  Rooms too small superior single avoid rooms located close to the noisy elevator it even rings during the night Windows open 10 inches.

Not much .  Lovely staff Great location Free wi fi Fridge microwave and iron ironing board inside the room Lots of channels on TV .  Mediterranean Greek influences on the dinner offering rather limited our eating choices No real option to eat elsewhere it involves public transport .  Staff very efficient Room was well equipped and comfortable .  Our room was a corner room on floor 5 which was very small We have stayed before and the bathroom had a bath and the room was very spacious but this time we found the room was small quite dull with no bath.  The location of the hotel is excellent The onsite facilities are great .  Weak breakfast offer e g No vegetable empty fridge instead of minibar .  Nice location.  Nothing.  Quiet hotel with good central location.  nothing we loved it all.  staff were superb friendly and helpful We loved the substantial tapas which came with drinks and the old black and white films in the bar The location is superb for shopping and the design is stunning .  Our first room had the toilet behind a glass door next to the shower which had an open floor plan to the bedroom I preferred the privacy of our second room where the bathroom was down a hallway and separated from the bedroom by a door .  Friendly staff Hotel just 2 blocks from Las Rambles the heart of the city .  We booked an Executive King Room for a special occasion wish I hadn t bothered Overpriced very small room very hot with a very small bathroom The rest of the hotel was very tired .  The staff were very nice Bed was very comfortable .  Bar shut at 1pm.  Great if you are going to Wembley. No Negative.  Everything about it Location look the staff the bar Just outstanding. No Negative.  I forgot something in the mini bar and the staff contacted me via email and informed me about my forgotten items That shows that they really care about their customers . No Negative.  everything excellent.  Television reception was awful no mini bar and fridge did not appear to work Only 2 of 4 lifts appeared to be working meaning long queues when leaving Bathroom was cramped .  Grest location and friendly staff but poor facilities .  Small room with tiny bathroom I didn t fit under the shower and I m not even 1 90 m .  Very comfortable and pleasant boutique hotel helpful friendly staff breakfast good value for money .  service.  location.  On the last day the cleaner didn t clean our room We stayed out from 9 30 am till 3 30 pm Before leaving the room we put the warning please clean the room on the door He justified himself saying that we had asked NOT to clean the room .  Attentive helpful and corteous staff excellent breakfast and excellent location .  A 4 star hotel that had no in room information about any on site amenities like restaurant or gym Only a brochure about massage We went to ask about food and they referred us outside the hotel After a turbulent flight and jet lag that wasn t optimal for us We reserved a mini room which would have been sufficient for our very short stay and were upgraded But a staffer lectured us that the room wasn t really appropriate for adults more for young people traveling and warned that next time we would not be guaranteed an upgrade .  Nice towels large bathroom comfortable bed Upgrade to larger room Convenience to train station Free wi fi. No Negative.  Location Friendly helpful staff .  I didn t particularly liked the food of the room service order at 1 00am It was delivered pretty quick perhaps wasn t so fresh the pasta was badly overcooked and the ceaser salad there was way too much sauce compare how much salad there was shame really as the few lettuce I could test did taste quite fresh We also ordered an hamburger that was slightly better but still for the comparison quality price NO GOOD for me I do have to say that when I checked out I have gently complained to the reception and with much apologies and with no effort they haven t charge me for the ceaser salad and the pasta .  I liked the bedroom especially the size of the bed and the shower bath I liked all the staff that was very helpful all the way through outstanding from the concierge to the receptionist .  Small bed.  Great staff large bathroom.  After hours room service was a bit too basic Didn t have some of the items on the menu .  Location was absolutely fantastic Really quiet room .  Nothing .  Very friendly staff at check in Adriana is the best Strategic location 5 10 min walk from paddington tube heathrow express. No Negative.

No Negative.  Great location helpful staff big room and very comfortable bed.  The only thing we did not like was leaving to go home .  The rooms were cleaner every day to a very high standard with fresh sheets and clean towels everyday And the staff were extremely friendly at reception the cleaning staff and bar staff Everything was great .  The breakfast not so good.  Perfect location with a safe neighborhood Good modern decorations .  The bed was a bit too soft but it s a matter of personal taste I believe Once a room service decided to walk in despite the DND sign The room has a Nespresso machine but the capsules are only refilled once in two days .  The location is amazing in the hart of the city yet is 15 minutes walk or 5 minutes drive from the city airport train station Well designed and cozy room Not as big as one expect it to be in a five stars but still decent size Breakfast is 7 11 so it s convenient It s pretty good as well . No Negative.  Friendly helpful staff and modern look.  Having to leave .

Nice hotel Great location and easy to find Would recommend.  Some public transport ie trams a distance away .  Quiet situation size of room friendly helpful staff .  The city view from our 10th floor room was relatively obscured by the neighbouring building however we had been offered an upgrade to a more superior sea view room for a price that may have offered less obscured views .  This hotel was wonderful There was a very modern feel to it and a high level of professionalism from all the staff The rooftop pool area was fantastic .  Better view other than the carpark.  Comfy bed very clean.  I sent a mail to them and got a response after 24hrs and a second reminder Was expecting a quicker response time .  Enjoyed the breakfast Location is near a Metro station so the hotel is easily accessible .  No one talked through how to access WiFi however I particularly didn t need it but my partner did On the next morning a maid knocked and rang the room bell non stop once I got out of bed to make myself decent and opened the door she sheepishly apologised perhaps she thought the room was unoccupied However no excuse to interrupt my stay by banging like the police Not long after the door is knocking AGAIN I grabbed a towel to cover myself as I had JUST got out of the shower and instead of waiting for ME to open the door this employee whom usually works in the bar burst into the room I was stunned as it was approx 11 20am and check out is at 12noon and asked if I had helped myself to any products from the mini bar I said no and my parter had the same response No sorry no thank you nothing Unacceptable Room 405 11th 12th Nov 2016.  Loved the quick and friendly checking in process and general staff acknowledgement The breakfast was delicious and complimentary birthday cake was a really nice touch to make the evening special for my partner.  Nothing at all .

Everything You have experienced excellent and committed staff From the reception housekeeping breakfast to the spa they are all lovely People God bless them.  Nothing to complain about .  This hotel is a grand old lady well kept and somewhat majestic My room was well appointed with lovely fittings which suited the setting and the plumbing was modern The building itself is impressive and suits the architecture of Vienna but the location is absolutely unbeatable All of Vienna s top attractions were close by walking distance and there are lots of restaurants coffee shops and so on right there Hotel staff were all very attentive friendly and helpful and the breakfast buffet was excellent This is a top hotel and I will be staying there again when next in Vienna .

Staff were good room was very clean and modern overall a good hotel in a very handy location for us . No Negative.  The hotel was very nice and we enjoyed the room We liked the location to a bus stop and taking it into town was very easy If you get the 48hr pass make sure you ask everywhere you go if you can use it for discounts otherwise I recommend just paying for the bus each way from city center to hotel .  no negatives other than the price was a bit high and breakfast staff were not very friendly.  location location location The room was all I hoped it would be and more The view from the deck was nothing short of spectacular .  The room we were upgraded to featured a double bed made of two singles which kept moving apart .  We were upgraded on arrival which was lovely Shower and bathroom facilities were excellent Staff were always helpful and welcoming they spoke English and were more than happy to answer any questions we might have Location was perfect courtyard had lovely places to dine or get a cocktail 5 mins walk from the metro and not far from Notre Damme or the Pantheon Lovely area for dining .  Sadly the bed was quite bad and the bathrooms have a very strange tap system Taps operate two outlets so to turn them off completely it is very difficult and kept dripping and making noise We were there for 9 nights we had a few tries Also the food they serve is ok but not great Room service choices limited.

Builders swearing everybody knows Russian polish swear words nowadays breakfast staff seemed to be quite clueless and very slow kept disappearing so people kept coming and there was nobody to great them .

It was a lovely clean quiet hotel The reception staff were very friendly and helpful And one of the drivers at the hotel was very kind to me .  Executive double room and only one pkt biscuits .  Big bedroom Comfy beds and clean Even kettle was spotless .  No mirrors near a plug socket not good when trying to dry or straighten hair When we went down for breakfast we were automatically charged for the continental breakfast but once we were given the menu they had other options we only wanted a small breakfast of scrambled eggs on toast which was 5 90 yet we had been charged 11 90 for the continental and the 5 90 would of been on top of this Once we explained we only wanted the scrambled eggs the other was refunded and the breakfast was amended this option also included hot drinks .  Very quiet location only 10mins from attractions transports links Read reviews saying the rooms were small but we found the oom a decent size which were very clean and tidy no wardrobe space but for a few days did not cause us any issue maybe a longer stay or a family this may cause concern breakfast was nice once a issue was resolved .

We booked the restaurant in evening and when we went to pay we asked if we could split the bill as we were with friends and we had our son so ours was more and we were told it would take to much time and he was to busy to do it and we would have to do it ourselves so we then had to go off to one side and get our phones out to work it out for him We paid a lot to stay there and brought another 2 couples with us and I just felt his attitude was not in keeping with a restaurant and hotel like that and I would think twice about dining there again Other than that the other staff were lovely and helpful especially the concierge who was so friendly and helpful .  Fab location lovely rooms most of the staff were very helpful would definitely stay again .  The location of our suite was above the bar on the first floor Unfortunately there was a lot of noise from outside which resulted in a terrible night s sleep as I am a fairly light sleeper Not the hotel s fault and if I booked again I would ask for a quieter room .  This is a great hotel it looks impressive it is in a great location close to the museums stores restaurants and bars The tram is right outside the hotel and you can take the bus directly to the airport for 5 euros The hotel is immaculate staff were friendly friendly and very engaging and gave us the history of Amsterdam We were upgraded to a suite which had great views a double bath our own fire and sitting area and the bed was unbelievably comfortable .

The advert gave the deceptive impression the hotel was on the river bank in fact there was a block of flats inbetween the hotel and the river So if a view is important pay extra No one told us you need to use your room key to activate the lift to one s room floor Chaotic signing in computer down long delays getting to our room and then we were locked out the next day so that we would go down and give our details all over again We got the impression that our room wasn t allocated when we booked but first come first served in order of arrival Great wastage a new bar of soap every day part used shower gels shampoos etc thrown away and replaced New towels every day Having to take a bus between the centre of town to the hotel Our bill showed that every night was charged at a different rate depending on room occupancy.  lovely spacious room with enormous comfortable bed and superb sparkling ensuite reception staff stayed charming despite all manner of administrative problems which inconvenienced us .

The room was advertised with a bath and we actually received a room with a shower that was too small to turn around in I struggled to wash my hair in there and felt extremely chlostraphoebic You also couldn t open the windows You can also hear every noise throughout the hotel so we didn t get a very good sleep My partner is just over 6ft and was hanging out of the bed all night .  Staff were very friendly Close to tube and a tesco express McDonald s and burger king as well as a gym and pub Free bottle of water and biscuits included in the room Iron and ironing board also included .  The restaurant were charging a ridiculous amount for a full English breakfast I m happy to pay a premium for Michelin star chefs but egg bacon and sausage is egg bacon and sausage .  The views were amazing It s a beautiful hotel in a great location .  The ventilation system worked throughout the night and was very loud even after turning the controller off Didn t get much sleep as a result .  The staff was excellent and very friendly .  Nothing really perhaps eggs and mushrooms at breakfast could have been better cooked eggs not cooked on top so slimy and mushrooms not sauted but done in water which made them a bit grey .

The room was beautifully cleaned everyday The pillows were amazing . No Negative.  Really liked the 12 o clock checkout .  I didn t like the fact we wasn t made aware of maintenance work going on in the rooms opposite ours which had me awake on my very first morning early However they made up for it by upgrading our room to an executive suite for the rest of our stay .

The room was decent size and clean The bed was comfortable We were only in the room to sleep as we had a busy evening and an even busier following day We were on the other side of the hotel this time facing the street rather than the motor way so it was quieter .  I was given a quite small room for standard double room I was given a room with a lot less space since I have a huge wall cutting off the space of the room Looks really different from the picture location is not too close to the city center requires minimum walk of 20 minutes location is also a bit hidden in a small alley that does not feel safe at night At one point the electricity in my room went off and only after I called the reception that they got this fixed AC works centrally so If you feel warm you can t turn it on .  bar was okay freebie to drink at the bar if you did not request for a housekeeping service bedding was comfy clean staff were nice . No Negative.  everything is just great i cant say that enough and i have recommended Alma to all my friends who are making plans for Barcelona the staff is the most welcoming and helpful hotel staff in the world the location is wonderful especially for those who are ready for a shopping spree the city itself is another surprise sunshine beautiful architecture the most amazing seafood nice people everything is just perfect .

No Negative.  Beautiful hotel location and staff.  room was a bit worn out also furnishers were a little used up and overall we got the feeling that the place was in need of refurbishment Overall quite ok but hey where is value for my money .  very central location easy to find and close walking distance to allmost everything Most friendly stuff all clean and service of high standard .

Nearer to a tube station but that can t be helped Hotel is great .  Views from the bedroom windows were outstanding Big Ben and London Eye.  Non applicable.  Very close to metro station Safe neighborhood.  Additional high car park charge Disturbances by hotel residents in adjacent rooms However more a reflection of the behaviour and manners of the hotel residents rather than quality of the hotel .

WIFI performance in the evening can be poor or even very poor Insufficient noise insulation among the rooms If people next door decide to be noisy you will hear it .

Excellent location quiet room I can recommend it.  The price quoted by hotel over the phone was 150 pounds more than it cost me by using bookings com .  Staff were exceptional Bed was amazing View of trees yet location was within walking distance of everything .  Bed was a little soft for my liking but not uncomfortable Decor a little dated and tired looking but ok and clean Got in late from the airport and arranged a late checkout despite this was woken early well before before normal checkout time by very persistent housekeeping who didn t speak English so couldn t explain that I had a late checkout Receptionist did apologise and not her fault but I did hear housekeeping bashing on all the doors along the corridor so am sure I wasn t the only one who may have been affected .

It was very trendy The food was great I loved the design of the hotel and the little touches like the radio being on and the breakfast in a bag .  difficult to find.  breakfast rooms and staff.  lift was out of order for the two days i stayed six floors is good exercise but this was treated by staff as a minor issue sorry not our fault type response with no attempt to deal with possible implications or inconvenience.  friendly small hotel near RER station.  The mattress was probably the worst mattress I have ever slept on in a hotel If the hotel were a two star this would be somewhat acceptable but it is unacceptable for a four star There is nothing worse than taking a nicer hotel with the hope of being rested for business meetings and in the end getting a horrible night s sleep Also I could hear pretty much everything in the room next to me as there was a door connecting the two rooms I could literally hear someone masturbating on the other side of the door Once again that may be expected at a flophouse but not a four star hotel .  Great location beautiful interior patio space friendly staff access to a sauna but don t forget your bathing suit . No Negative.  Nice hotel with good facilities Room was small but comfortable 20 minutes or so walk to the main Piazza and Cathedral which wasn t too bad .  Breakfast is outrageously expensive 17 50 for Continental breakfast I couldn t eat enough food to make it worth that Full English was an eye watering 23 00 Yes really 23 00 I d expect a whole pig for that The range of breakfast foods on Saturday was nowhere near as wide as Friday That made the value at 17 50 for Continental even worse on Saturday The croissants were rather poor Seemed like the cheap ones from the supermarket I ll stay at the Doubletree almost next door next time .

Free upgrade to top floor and extra large bed was icing on the cake. No Negative.  Great hotel Liked the restaurant and the neighborhood Concierge Alexandra was very helpful .  Not being told that the hotel is going through a major refurbishment I wouldn t have booked We couldn t stay at the hotel during day time because my daughter has asthma it was too dusty It is UNETHICAL not to inform your potential customers about the major refurbishment on the website By far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in We felt cheated .  nothing.  Some of the staff didn t seem to know what was going on and check in was chaotic .  Really good size room Central location easy to get to major landmarks and metro .  False fire alarm at 4am They couldnt turn it off for half an hour It still buzzess in my ears Didnt rest too well . No Positive.

We requested a late checkout since our flight from Malpensa was delayed The Reception staff was very helpful and gave us a 3 hrs extension without asking for additional payment .  5 euros for City tax even the property was outside the city .

Clean and spacious room with good facilities .  rooms at rear of hotel prone to noise from outside some lights were out and the expelair in bathroom wasn t working or wasn t there .  Was upgraded from a room without window to a room with one value for money and great transport links.  Nothing.  There was nothing to dislike. No Negative.  Warm reception on arrival Welcome drink and help with luggage Coffee machine in room and rain shower Very comfortable bed It is easy to catch Tram 16 into city centre .  Rooms a little cramped.  Quiet location close to tube and Hyde Park.  Only thing is not quite right at the time is the roadworks on one side of the hotel however this did not effect us .  Location was out of the city centre however on the number 12 tramline which was direct to the the museum quarter The hotel was good our room was quiet and the breakfast was just too much Staff excellent package deal good price Good for train from Schipol airport 10 mins plus 10 minute walk . No Negative.  The staff were very helpful and pleasant .  The price of the champagne.  Bed was very comfortable.  Would like to have been a little closer to centre couldn t walk there as too far.  Beds really comfortable rooms lovely and clean.  Quite a disaster in that someone walked into my room another guest had been allocated the room some 5 hours after I had been If I had not been in the room she could have stolen my property Very poor on the part of the hotel Wi fi very poor too Breakfast was cold tea bacon and scrambled eggs Only redeeming feature was that they had gluten free bread As I had stayed here several times since 1976 I was very disappointed Food in the restaurant mainly Asian .  It s location Beside the main shops and underground Convenient to Kensington gardens and a good taxi service at the hotel .  The room was freezing because my heating was broken No one came up to fix it which was a huge shame and I ended up waking up with a bad cold and sore throat Mini bar also wasn t stocked .

None.  Location staff and vicinity.  Breakfast little bit expensive .  Location near the train station cleanliness secure and nice staff . No Negative.  A lovely room with canal view and very spacious Thank you .  Free WI fi is only for one piece for the person per day Why Now everyone has at least one laptop and one mobile Not convenient at all The only one bad thing but spoils your mood .  The staff was very friendly and helpful especially Lucia the best I believe She is a future administrator manager of the hotel She was always so really helpful giving us great train connections schedules recommendations I couldn t do better by myself though I am an experienced traveler and always do all preparations very thoroughly The hotel is located near the railway station which gives you the best connection around Milano as well as to other places if you have some time to travel within 1day Good breakfasts and cozy beds and tea coffee in the room is a great option .  Mirror intact room very high and I m nearly 6ft so had to use long mirror to dry hair But lead too short on dryer.  Location and room allowed us to work easily evening and morning Staff were fantastic.  I am a gold member with IHG I wanted check out at 530pm I was charged for late check out This is not what other hotels do if you are a gold member . No Positive.  It was freezing cold Temp in my room was 18degrees which I could see on the aircon panel It was impossible to heat up the room After hours of sitting in sweaters in bed with aircon set up to max heating it was 19 5 degrees This is unacceptable I complained and was promised a heater but noone brought it to my room My colleagues had another room and it was the same I also got mail that I can t get breakfast and can pay 10eur for cereal and order it to my room What a pleasure to sit in this freezing room and eat cold breakfast I definitely do not recommend to anyone .  Nothing special as for the high price . No Negative.  Great location Nice room.  Room was not clean . No Positive.  Shabby grubby carpet.  Staff were fabulous location was great room was very shabby but clean.  Fire Alarm which was a test and the hotel did not inform us before and it made us feel panic and confused we leaved our room scarily when the alarm started and then we asked the staff what is going on they just said it was a test and they put information on the Check in desk which we did not see it before and we did not know every they we have to go in checking desk to get info like this Also The staffs were not friendly and helpful The room was hot and it was not possible to change the temperature because of old system which the staff told us and there were no air conditioner they told us it works only in summer The location was not good because for reaching the city centre we have to take a train which last at least 40 minutes long and the train plan was also not regular which is not the fault of Hotel and in this case we had to pay more attention to the distance .  Free shuttle Bus .  Bed not particularly comfortable and door lock wouldn t engage.  Very good location nice decor and free choc chip cookie upon check in.  Breakfast would be better if started earlier perhaps 630 or 7 for early start travellers.  Warm and helpful reception Great facilities clean quiet and comfortable .  Having a breakfast included in our special offer .  The helpfulness of the staff .  Wifi poor connection kept failing Noise from upstairs in early morning .  Breakfast choices and courteous staff Nice decor.  Walls are quite thin.  Location is great staff is welcoming.  The 150 deposit blocked from my card .  Comfy clean rooms near underground Gloucester .  I d have liked a proper balcony .  Great staff lovely rooms fantastic roof top bar great location .  Air conditioning unit abouve the bed was too noisy .  Good customer service friendly . No Negative.  Access to fresh air via balcony great staff good location.  No iron and iron table.  Cleanness and easy access to train station and subways.  There was nowhere to sit in our room except on the bed A slightly larger room with a loveseat and or chair would have been better Also the breakfast room is extremely uncomfortable There are tiny little stools to sit on without back support .  Henley House is conveniently located near the Earl Gray tube stop It is in a quiet neighborhood and the staff is GREAT .  The room had a bad smell which was not dealt with during my stay i reported it several times but wasnt solved by the hotel. No Positive. No Negative.  Excellent and helpful service .  The room was quite small and I would have preferred a view of the canal .  The staff were amazing and the breakfast was delicious . No Negative.  Central location lovely spa facilities friendly helpful staff . No Negative.  staff attended to all our needs Location was great for walking to most attractions.  nothing.  The beds were very comfortable and the spa was very relaxing .  Two things for poor rating and you should consider the first when reading this 1 The hotel refused to cancel my reservation free of charge even I canceled 24h before arriving which was aligned with the terms and conditions 2 There is no Free WiFi in the rooms which I believe to be essential and and must have.  Access to subway Good room .  Nothing.  All ok staff were great room lovely and great value for money. No Negative.  All this and a great historic building saved John Betjaman will be pleased that it is now back in use .  free bar .  all perfect will definatly return.  Nothing at all.  Stuff is perfect friendly location.  The TV was clearly connected to the internet it sometimes had a delay The food we ordered from room service was okay but could have been better .  Very clean comfortable contemporary .  We couldn t sleep because the noise of the pipes was unbearable It stopped eventually after 2 am when we getting ready to ask to change room which big nuisance for one night stay and we also thought that it might be the same in all the rooms The noise woke us up before 6 am I assume that the noise stops only if no one on the floor or in the same line is using bathroom The staff wasn t rude but they gave impression that they couldn t care less I haven t argued with them just mentioned the problem we had As there was not much interest to listen I gave up When we passed by later to pick up the luggage no one greeted us both coming in and out Not because I complained because there were other people at the desk but just because they don t seem to care It s not really important I know but it s unpleasant It s a 4 star hotel i e you spend quite a lot you expect them to at least say hi .  The location is good very central but silent The room is spacious and the bathroom is nice and new .  Shower temperature difficult to regulate.  Tv remote had been sanitised Comfortable bed Excellent staff .  Bit more information on the self service dinner arrangement in advance would have been helpful but the food was delicious No pots for the tea and no choice about paying for tea coffee as no facilities in the room .  The location is excellent restaurants and the Tate just across the road and the Hotel itself is welcoming and funky The room was small but sparkling great shower and super intelligent use of space Free films juices and a fabulous bed Slick online check in and check out but with lively staff not far away if you met a problem Nice common living room areas .  Nothing.  Everything.  The bar prices were pretty expensive .  Excellent location Really friendly and polite staff Nice bar area and great gym didn t have time to use it but the facilities looked great Room was smaller than expected but very clean and comfortable . No Negative.  Very clean Staff very efficient and friendly .  Nothing.  I have stayed here twice now but the superior deluxe rooms with private terrace and pool are well worth that bit extra .  Breakfast was not included but had a great variety of food and pastries Found that European hotels either included it or it was 20 Euros or more per person .  The staff was very friendly and accommodating The property was very beautiful well maintained and on a quiet picturesque canal .  Decor in the rooms curtains carpets etc a little dated .  Rooms were clean and comfy staff friendly and helpful Great location 1 min walk to tube station and Hyde Park . No Negative.  the staff were friendly and efficient as well as extremely helpful at all times After a long exhilarating day in London it was wonderful to come back and relax in our excellent accommodation .  my room was a bit hot and I couldn t regulate it but my daughters was fine .  With a 4 year old and 1 year old it was ideal and children were made welcome.  The price is prohibitive .  Excellent location lovely decorated lots of personality and pure English athmosphere .  Sad face unwelcoming receptionist at night time who took ages to get us room We were told that if we are coming back late on Sunday night then we can park the car outside the hotel which we did as there was no one to facilitate car parking We got the ticket by warden in the morning As we complaint the car parking manager David was extremely rude and nausty The whole stay was put to a sour experience There is no coherence between hotel staff and car parking valet services and they kept on passing us to each other No apology given It has been terrible experience with unfriendly staff at all levels.  Location was good Rest was terrible.  Beds were a little hard Had to fold pillow to make higher .  Location cleanliness quietness especially at night Bar on site .  Dining facilities adequate but expensive and seemed to be little used we breakfasted in the train station Front desk often busy checking guests in out which made it hard to get information .  Convenient location if travelling by train Room was comfortable clean and well equipped Great top floor view over plaza Pleasant 20 minute walk to the Montjuic area that includes the Fundacio Joan Miro the Museu National d Art de Catelunia both very worthwhile .  WiFi not too strong everywhere You couldn t set the room temperature only to be 3 degrees from the ambient temp .  Location.  Room was a bit small but I assume there are bigger rooms for the right price .  Clean and spotless New furniture Incredible staff and services Amazing Will be coming back for sure . No Negative.  Clean and comfortable Location exactly where I needed to be . No Negative.  It s great location Hotel nice and clean staff were friendly and helpful.  Location. No Positive. No Negative.  We spent 3 nights August 26th 28th on the recommendation of a family member We were delighted with the location on Parallel Ave which was in walking distance to the beach port Las Ramblas Placa Catyluna and the Metro station The hotel facilities are excellent as are the staff We would highly recommend this hotel.  No maps for the city were provided The concierege was not that helpfull. No Positive.  A bit too expensive for personal trips to London and so contradicts the ethos of being a charity for students and alumni This was a business trip but I d like to return for a personal stay but it s difficult to pay so much .  The Staff were so welcoming and friendly and I was treated like a King A real haven in a busy city a home from home Will definitely return for business Shame the prices are so high these days re private use Special thanks to Sam Ahmed and the other lovely people on reception .  The rate was expensive so didn t provide value for money but we understand that there was an annual conference in the city which contributed to the high rate .  Very well located and helpful staff A good 4 star hotel .  Small rooms No fridge in rooms .  Location.  The room was nowhere near a five star accommodation The lights were impossible to work and the electrical sockets worked 20 of the time The bathroom was terribly thought out There was no bath tub and the shower would leak ALL over the bathroom despite my considerable efforts to contain the spray The tap in the sink was about 1 5 inches off the bowl so getting your hands under it was difficult Furthermore the lights in the bathroom were far too dim and seeing your face in the one properly sized mirror of the room was difficult Finally the walls have the sound insulation qualities of cardboard I could loudly hear a phone ringing at 6am everyday from the room next door There was also loud construction and hammering sounds that my wife and I were constantly hearing Sleeping a full night especially with jet lag was totally impossible Also the blinds in the room were ripped and closing them was very difficult and they were very shoddy looking In the event we were to shower twice in one day we had to reuse our towels because there were not enough in the room There were problems and irritations everywhere we turned It was NOT a comfortable experience .  The staff was lovely and seemed to show genuine concern for my complaints I very much appreciated them .  Loved everything.  Location was in a lovely area Quiet area Spacious room and bathroom Welcoming cocktail Great outdoor space with beautiful flowers Terry cloth robes were cozy after shower Great bar area Frankie was helpful and so welcoming.  Too small Bed Room Transactions with different name One rude front desk lady staff .  Clean friendly staff . No Negative.  Excellent breakfast buffet very good service Exceptionally robust security arrangements for getting into the hotel and returning Also the internal hotel security was very visible in all areas I particularly liked the two bars within the Icon Bar one for residents one for public Food was available and was served very promptly so good planning ahead as this was a very busy time just following the Cup Final Would definitely stay again .  Nothing.  The bed was more than like on a cloud. No Negative.  Great location comfortable beds great room Staff very friendly .  Nothing wrong.  A lovely hotel room Cosy and nicely decorated Everything was thought of.  Double bed was two singles pushed together.  Food excellent and surrounding architecture both contemporary and traditional.  The hotel s decor and facilities are somewhat dated The bath shower was untidy and the shower screen was problematic For a 5 hotel I expected more attention to detail .  The location was perfect and our family room was spacious and comfortable .  There was a fluff of hair on the bathroom floor when I checked in the room carpet in room was stained .  Location size and decor of the room comfortable mattress nice and attentive personnel at Reception . No Negative.  Close to MiCo very clean.  Superior canal view had to be viewed while on balcony standing up not what was displayed on the Internet Fantastic location made up for the view Next time I will not pay up for a view and I would not hesitate to stay again Great place to stay .  Staff was absolutely wonderful showing us on a map major attractions in walking distance Convenient bus stop right outside Clean room Computer and printer available for guests Dining on site with great staff again too .  See above together with what I like Overall it is a great place to be However it is excessively priced as far as room charge internet in the room and underground parking .  The hotel is not in good shape Massive refreshment modernization would be required It is absurd that a breakfast costs euro 31 per person unless it is booked with the room It is also a bad idea to charge euro 25 for internet in the room Overall it is a rip off However breakfast is great quality and the vicinity of public transport is a great advantage .  The stay didn t record my honors points.  I like the buffet breakfast.  My room was not ready until 2 so we went and had something to eat and went back at 2 then it still wasn t ready they said they would come to us at the bar when it was no one did we had to go to the desk about 4 times to ask for them to keep saying it was in progress annoying when we had tickets to go somewhere and needed to get ready and freshen up ended up rushing about and been 5 mins late.  The tablets beside the bed and the spa was excellent.  Way too Hot in the Room.  Good Location easy access from Tube. No Negative.  Excellent location near Eiffel Tower Metro subway RER railroad and upscale shopping the interior designer did an excellent job Great breakfast buffet .  Reception needs to be more organized paperwork takes time The power went out when I connected their iron I had to contact the reception to send a technician to get the power back .  The location and the interior design . No Negative.  The staff was very polite .  Room needed a bit of a refurb.  Staff and location perfect.  Toilet was small and slight draft from window .  The room was really nice Spacious and clean .  I did not find the crew friendly just acceptable However the prices are quite high One night we paid close to 300 euros and they kept me ranging up in the room until I went down to the reception to pay Not really acceptable on this level Be prepared that you have to wait for the elevators 5 7 minutes whenever you use them The walls are really thin you can hear everything what is at the neighbours and on the corridors Big disappointment is the WIFI So after you pay 300 euros a night you have to register yourself or give your Facebook account in order to use it No one wants to be spammed with their unwanted marketing offer after you pay this amount per night .  The small restaurant they have is nice The express menu is good but more importantly they bring is fast View is pretty nice to the sea side and there is a small pool on the roof top . No Negative.  The staff are excellent All are friendly and well trained Thanks for the great stay .  11am check out way to early Bar small and part of the restaurant.  Location Value for money clean tidy good quality environment.  In the room we were staying every morning around 8 00 we could here water being flushed through some of the piping in the wall this did not bother me as I slept right through it but for my mother it s was harder to sleep .  The staff were extremely friendly and couldn t be more helpful Food at the hotel restaurant city bar was incredible and the location was great the hotel was within walking distance of almost everything and they had a map that was very easy to read so that you could get everywhere . No Negative.  Good location Breakfast was great .  Not a lot really Bedding looked a little worn in places but was perfectly clean Very minor .  Staff friendly room clean and tidy Quiet Well organised Great breakfast Perfect location for tube also ideal having a car park under the hotel Second visit to hotel Will definitely use again when coming to London .  Worst trained staff i have ever experienced its hard to believe in the hospitality industry with an well respected chain such as the radison that staff were rudely asking us to leave I have never been so angry and upset in all my years traveling the world . No Positive.  Should have been cleaner and sown of the fittings were shabby .  Good facilities And the 360 deck on the roof is great.  Lounge club offer is zero .  Location restaurant.  1 Waiting time at reception rather long before being served 2 Lift service rather slow 3 First night room has no climate control on the thermostat so really stuffy and warm Moved to another room for the rest of our stay problem solved and had better night sleep .  Locality near to supermarket good local restaurants cafes and tram bus stop Direct bus no 21 to Central Station within 15 minutes and direct tram no 14 to Dam square around 15 minutes great accessibility . No Negative.  The room we had on the ground floor was one of the new revamped ones it was lovely and clean bed was really comfortable you just sank into it staff were fabulous food was lovely afternoon tea and bar snacks and the breakfast was just well all i can say is that you are spoilt for choice .  NA.  Clean room Helpful staff Good price .  The lighting in both our room and the main restaurants was subdued with no option to use a stronger light for a specific purpose For example this made it really difficult to read your dinner menu with ease Atmosphere at the expense of practicality .  Location of the hotel plus the young and helpful staff in the reception concierge and restaurant areas .  No stairs so always waiting for elevator Coffee at breakfast.  Room nearby Metro.  The restaurant menu in the hotel was pricey and limited selection .  Our room was on the top floor room 601 It had a balcony and was newly refurbished The bathroom was lovely and the room was massive We were beyond satisfied Such a comfortable stay SO central everything is on your doorstep and the tram is right outside for further exploring We had the best nights sleep there .  Receptionist was not over friendly on arrival and tried to tell me that I would pay for breakfast extra to my booked rate This was not what had been booked Fortunately on check out this was not an issue .  Very comfortable and attractive.  Basically let down by housekeeping and room size Rooms are not big enough for families although advertised as such Often used glasses and trash were not removed Random number of towels each day no room service despite having a room service menu they answered the phone but said nothing was doable so we gave up and the room was over heated not helped by four people in a very small room Hairdryer didn t work and safe ran out of power locking our valuables irretrievably inside until it was re charged .  Good location Greenwich and Blackheath are great plus Canary Wharf is a 10 min DLR ride away and accessible to the rest of London within 40 mins plus all usual amenities such as gym bar and restaurant Reception staff helpful and friendly . No Negative.  Room small but comfortable Staff very nice located 7 minutes from Earls Court Tube.  View from room but understand not all rooms can be on the front.  Location and staff were excellent We had a issue with our booking but this was resolved quickly and very helpfully.  Thick bacon .  Facial mist was really nice .  The hotel is old rooms not sound isolated you can hear other customers and staff at 6am in the hallway Staff opened our room door very early in the morning without knocking Staff at the reception were not welcoming nor smiling .  The location of the hotel was very convenient within a walking distance from the center The breakfast is good too and very rich . No Negative.  Location is top priority and this hotel has everything practically at it s doorstep . No Negative.  Staff.  Distance to downtown and the fact that inly tram2 could give us a ride .  The hotel is nice and clean however accesing downtown is just too hard far .  No air conditioning and difficulty in opening window NO LIFT. No Positive. No Negative.  Very clean rooms polite staff location close to metro station.  too small a bed for 2.  classic best western standard.  My room was cold no matter how i adjusted the temp Toilet is cold with no heated bars for towels etc.  Good breakfast selections Great location as well .  Staff at reception were mostly helpful and friendly but not all and this is what matters the most when you have arrived in a city like London for the first time Also we found the house brasserie pretentious and overpriced .  The location was very good for us We were able to explore the city and there were lots of places to eat nearby . No Negative.  The staff is so friendly and the location is perfect Like the breakfast as well worth for 15 eur.  I stayed in a twin room that literally had the smallest beds just 2 6 and I am sure the requirement for an adult is 3 wide and no window They should just make this room a single if it is considered too small for two adult size beds There is a fake window but when you look out you are looking at a sort of air vent which certainly needs cleaning up We chose this for the location close to Olympia and on the website they advertise bathrobes and ipod dock neither were in the room It actually didn t bother us particularly as we were working but you shouldn t have to ask for things that are supposed to be included.  Generally I would recommend the hotel is quite small and although the rooms are not that big they have nice furnishings and the staff were nice and friendly I would go back but would be careful to choose another room I work in the travel industry so like to be fair with my comments there were a couple of negatives but on the whole don t let this review put you off as my complaints were to do with the one room I am sure the others are lovely .  We had a room adjoining another one The door between the two rooms was so thin that sound travelled through it as if it wasn t there Made it very noisy in the evening when we went to bed before the other couple who stayed up until 2am .  Great location in the city very clean modern hotel very comfortable beds .  Overall a tired room Old TV Difficult to connect to wifi boiling hot shower noisy air on in the night Just little irritants Expensive drinks in the bar bordering on extortionate.  Good bed at a conference and that was well managed Very good dinner service. No Negative.  Beautiful hotel rooms were comfortable resteraunts and bars are great a little expensive but you really get what what you pay for Perfect birthday weekend treat 5 .  I.  Location was near to the metro station the rooms were big and clean.  TV channel selection was poor .  Comfy beds and helpful friendly staff .  None .  Location is very good And the room is clean and the view is good outside is a small green garden Nice place .  No negatives No issues.  Excellent location for las ramblas and 2 metro stations friendly professional staff Good choice at breakfast standard bedroom very big for a city centre hotel Very clean Would recommend this hotel to all travellers. No Negative.  Really good steak.  Bathroom of triple room 218 a little tiny for 3 persons.  Super breakfast Amazing bed and pillows . No Negative.  Staff Cleanliness Location .  Felt that the rooms were a bit basic for the price we paid in comparison to other Hilton hotels we have stayed at I also struggled to obtain hot water on one occasion.  Really good location and staff were friendly and helpful. No Negative.  The location of the hotel is in excellent proximity to tourist attractions and travel Buffet breakfast is good value Staff were extremely helpful friendly and English speaking .  Constant phone calls from the front desk with no caller Very little desk horizontal space for storage reading working No heat despite complaints room like an icebox for most of stay Nicest staff member was the cleaner. No Positive.  Everything was great but nobody mentioned that we will need to pay extra fee for the parking spot . No Positive. No Negative.  the service was even better than always I stayed there for about 7 times .  Room was tired Bed mattress was broken and creaking room overlooked main road high traffic noise Shower in bath insufficient headroom.  Food of good standard Staff very efficient.  Nothing we enjoyed our stay .  The staff were really friendly and accommodated us with all our requests .  Nothing.  Understanding customer needs.  I opted out of the breakfast It is very expensive and outside there are several caf s where you can grab something cheaper.  The rooms were very clean The decoration is good and in general maintenance is great The hotel has a great service for printing The location is good it has very quick access to two very well connected subway lines.  The third floor Not specifically disable friendly as has a lot of stairs to most of the rooms .  TV available alongside a large mirror Great little room .  Wifi could be a little more powerful But that s really the only thing I could say it was wonderful .  Pancakes are amaaaaaaazing Staff is really friendly and caring Location is perfect The room was spacious and comfortable .  Size of the double bedroom makes it not too roomy for 2 people The 2 beds were basically set as one king size bed which is not good if you don t want to sleep next to the other person .  Beautiful view of the city including side view of the Eiffel Tower Easy access to everything including public transportation and restaurants Nice soft and clean sheets along with soft pillows Clean comfortable bathroom well equipped with toiletries . No Negative.  This is a gem Location is perfect for travel steps from the rail station but quiet and super modern Food buffet is great .  Minor problem a lot of flies buzzing around the eating area.  Lovely hotel excellent breakfast convenient location.  Nothing.  I love the location.  The rooms are a little small and there were no drawers or shelves I saw There is no proper bathroom a box with a shower a box with a toilet and a sink .  The staff was very professional and attentive The bar and restaurant are great .  Breakfast a little bit of a production line on the weekend prob easier to have room service expect its fine on week days Still very tasty .  Excellent air conditioning and although train tracks behind didn t hear it at all A stones throw from the Babylon roof garden restaurant too .  Location to reach the beach you have to cross the motor way . No Positive.  expensive bar area just a corridor Busy road separates hotel from sea opposite a skate park so noisy in the evenings.  location good for CCIB breakfast good room had a balcony with sea views.  Wifi doesn t work at all breakfast very basic bed was awful and uncomfortable it has pillows glued to the head board we had to get a spare quilt out and use that as a extra pillow No ironing board or iron Could hear through the walls of other people coughing Tele was very small one English Channel No bedside draws Air con didn t work it was SO hot Window wouldn t stay open and was next to a building site so was too loud open No apple juice or English sausages at breakfast or Nutella just small things .  Nice shower very modern Friendly staff Toothbrush and toothpaste provided but only one when they re is two people staying Right by a metro station and market and tram Zara McDonald s pull and bear literally over the road Blind is on a switch which is pretty cool Maids came everyday .  a bit noisy if accomodated on Via Largo Augusto after corner or Via Francesco Sfortza It is better to request a room on the reception side .  Excellent central location well trained staff nice rooms Nice gym Nice selection of spirits and wines in the lobby bar .  Shower was a little small hit my elbow a few times and you heard a bit of door banging from the surrounding rooms Also the tram runs along the road directly outside and if you are a very light sleeper this may disturb you we were on the 2nd floor and they start running from around 5 30am .  Location was excellent close to the main train station the metro main tram stop a supermarket chemist and a wonderful Italian restaurant The staff were amazingly helpful and the breakfast range was extensive and very tasty Room was cleaned everyday and the hotel staff held our bags at no extra charge so that we could have the day sightseeing before check in My sister and I felt very comfortable walking around this neighborhood at night Would certainly stay here again . No Negative.  Location cleanliness friendly and helpful service at breakfast.  gym facilities could be developed.  friendly helpful staff excellent location.  No negatives at all .  Facilities and rooms are excellent Modern design .  The shower seems to be outdated not only was it not so clean but as well the pressure was low.  location of the hotel Staff very friendly and go the extra step for anything you need Size of the room Breakfast is great they have even Nespresso .  The shower needed a screen to protect the remainder of the bathroom shower water tended to spray everywhere even with using little pressure .  Nice and quiet Comfy beds Awesome location with useful rail links around the remainder of Paris . No Negative.  Loved the cool design throughout the hotel Breakfast was great and staff very friendly Liked the location as you got to see a bit of the outer city on the stroll into the city centre .  Evening dinner not kept warm enough .  Breakfast was good also shower Bed comfy .  There is no business center If you need to print you must send an email to the concierge It invades your privacy Also if you are expecting a pool to be included in this luxurious boutique hotel don t The hotel does not have a pool Beware There is no value here You are going to pay for luxury .  The junior suite rooms are highly accommodating spacious and comfortable Nothing has been spared The location of the hotel is terrific Easy to get around the city Tour buses city buses metros taxis and the train No car required unnecessary .  Ice machine wasn t working on our floor No fresh air inability to open windows.  Breakfast options were great good variety and quality Good location to the O2.  That I couldn t stay longer had to go home.  Quality of hotel and it s convenient location.  Renovation disruptive .  Room clean and comfortable Concierge staff very good They reserved a 3 hour drive around city with my handicapped guest Driver wonderful This location near to museum can t be beat Two great days worth trip from London on Eurostar .  Position of room 418 next to noisy outside air con unit Hand shower only First allocated room 316 had double bed one side against wall no fridge safe and noisy outside air con .  Good size standard room General cleanliness Good customer service when changing room .  The carpets on the corridors and room would deserve to be replaced and resume the original color . No Positive.  While the hotel was lovely for the most part we found the restaurant lacking in service and cleanliness Things seemed very disorganized while we were there with dirty dishes left on tables and messes left at the buffet It was difficult getting the attention of anyone if we needed something so we just did it ourselves Believe it or not we could not connect our adaptor in the bathroom so I could use my hot curling brush for my hair They only had something for men s razors which seemed very odd to me I ended up sitting on the floor near the bed doing my hair in front of a tiny mirror as all the outlets that took adaptors were on walls away from mirrors .  The Pullman Montparnasse was a lovely hotel with nicely appointed rooms It s a bit of a ways from everything so taking the train is a must if you are planning to tour all over the city The gracious lady who checked us in was very friendly and helpful .  nothing.  Fine hotel better than average comments.  Nothing.  Staff.  Loved everything.  Everything gym equipment was amazing.  The room was compact and efficient but lacked warmth very corporate and clinical feel.  Reception staff could not have been more helpful pleasant and accommodating .  The positioning of the bed against the window meant that the room was ideal for a single occupant but not for a couple.  Modern boutique style hotel with a free pantry facility and well appointed rooms. No Negative.  Just back from a wonderful three day break at the Langham A very special thank you to Vicky who made our stay extra special by her thoughtfulness and professionalism .  Little things that i would hope were high on the maintenance man s list i e slight damage to toilet flush .  The free upgrade was appreciated and the staff were helpful and ensured we got to where we needed to be .  The bed was very uncomfortable and way too soft .  Super location and the staff were terrific Perfect for a weekend stay and great shops and restaurants close by .  We took one small double room and that is really a small room I believe these small double rooms should not be allowed and do not fit a 4stars hotel because at the end is just a single room with the smallest possible double bed in the market Also to walk from one side of the room to the other I had to lean on the bed because the clearance was only 30 cms from the bed to the wall Of course we called booking com and they solved the problem and upgraded us to a proper double room .  Breakfast is very good location is quite nice you can easily walk to the hyde part or the natural history museum Personal is quite friendly and except the fact that the small double room should not be allowed everything was perfect .

On site restaurant Tozi was lovely. No Negative.  Welcomed with a warm smile staff couldn t do enough room was spacious and location amazing .  Rooms are quite small for more than 1 person Also rooms in higher category do not offer more space that the standard room .  Very friendly staff.  It was all great. No Positive.  Having to leave .  The buffet breakfast was excellent We went half an hour before it finished but you d never know Everything was still available and very fresh .  They should stop selling pigeon holes as rooms I have stayed in London before but this was a joke.  ok nothing great.  The aircon was terrible and there was no key to open the door Room was so hot and stuffy which effected our sleep .  The room was lovely and so was location.  Poor Internet uncomfortable beds temperature in the room is hard to regulate.  The staff is wonderful.  Facilities no hot tub not been used for months Same with treatment rooms Staff were embarrassed by lack of facilities claiming people don t use them.  Location is amazing Indian restaurant staff were brilliant.  Didn t get the goodbye gift everyone talks about The lady that checked us in was quite abrupt There was an odd smell to the hotel when you arrived Also put us in a room by the building works which is right outside hotel and very noisy Woke us up at 7 each morning.  Clean rooms Comfortable bed Nice bathroom.  Very expensive sandwiches and drinks in the local residents bar Roof top bar was too busy knee deep at the bar We didn t bother to queue .  Location was excellent for Wembley Stadium Staff were friendly Breakfast was nice Room was comfortable .  The breakfast staff were not helpful When we went for breakfast the restaurant was busy and we were asked to wait about 5 minutes to be seated They forgot about us and we had to approach them about our table After 25 minutes we were finally seated I was so upset I did not have a breakfast and left the restaurant in disgust at our treatment We won t be back.  Staff were courteous and helpful.  Somehow a little sterile rooms but nice in its own way .  Location is good Breakfast is good Quiet rooms .  I thought I had paid for breakfast when booking but not clear as it was only continental which admittedly was a nice spread but I have to pay and extra 5 for cooked breakfast as it described it as buffet and last time I visited the cooked was a buffet so misleading when I ordered the breakfast it was very nice farm quality produce and better than he old buffet selection.  Clean friendly staff and very helpful rooms modern and well equipped.  Over charged They over charged us 100 when we got there Rip off.  Modern.  Needed a socket near a mirror for hair drying straightening Building work commenced at 0750 in the morning and power was lost to the room twice . No Positive.  Breakfast was awful and a waste of money Room was too small and the bathroom was ridiculous I have seen bigger match boxes.  Some staff were nice and did try hard It I feel that a lot of the staff lacked the proper training.  The hotel was really nice but there was building works on the hotel and everywhere around the hotel we opened our blinds to a building site And we wasn t made aware of this before we booked the hotel and before we arrived .  Room was clean very nice we were greeted with a bottle of champagne and chocolates as it was our anniversary .  Worse concierge ever. No Positive.  I feel the staff were very slow and somewhat lazy Numerous times both my partner and I either visited reception or the bar and asked for help ordered a drink and each time is took more than 10 15 mins At one point I asked for one beer and the bar staff chose to answer her mobile instead I didn t like that there was a mini fridge in the room which was fully stocked but was never informed that we would be charged for anything we took this should be communicated stronger either when you check in or clearly stated on the fridge Your rooms should also have iron ironing board facilities rather than 1950 trouser presses and a modern hairdryer rather than a tube that blows out air from the wall .  The bed was super comfy The pool was lovely and relaxing .  Dinner is an easily forgettable meal We got upgraded to a disabled room which had a really distinctive unpractical disabled bathroom .  Breakfast was nice Room was big Location is really good close to the tube railway and buses Modern contemporary hotel with some nice touches .  It s a great location for the football but if you re spending more time in the city centre then it s a 20 25 minute metro ride .  Hotel is in a great location for the football You can see the ground from the driveway that leads to the hotel Room was comfortable and the staff I met were all good Didn t use the roof top pool or the spa but would consider staying again .  The parking fee was crazy and there were no discount for the hotel guests it was even more expensove than in the city centre Everything else was good .  The view through the window was simply amazing The breakfast was really good too . No Negative.  We didn t eat there but enjoyed the bar .  Value for the money of the breakfast Spa .  Location confort of the room.  The staff didn t listen properly and the room service was wrong every day The reception listen to me on checking out and causing me problems with my company .  The room was very nice.  reception.  good location.  Room dark lacking storage space.  Comfy bed good breakfast friendly helpful staff. No Negative.  Expert staff.  You need to take a tram to go to the city center .  The hotel is close to museums to a tram station and to a supermarket The hotel is very clean and the staff is very kind . No Negative.  Fantastic hotel The location is incredible The Born district is so fun and lively the best in Barcelona The room was very comfortable and had s great selection of TV channels Will only stay here the next time we are in Barcelona . No Negative.  The room was very comfortable and clean We were only at the hotel for a short duration but it was enjoyable . No Negative.  Its a lovely hotel this was our second stay.  no bad comments.  Convenient location for underground hyde park area.  Nothing.  Great design wonderful staff comfort bed nespresso in the room .  Location a bit of a distance and not much ambience .  One of the reception staff was a bit negative when we asked about restaurants and brunch places we wanted to go to saying it would be difficult to get a table as it would be busy and suggested we walked along tourist areas and tried our luck rather than showing us on the map where these were located or offering to call and see if they could get us a reservation In the end we found one of the places ourselves and managed to get a table too .  The windows were old and therefore a lot of wind was coming in .  Staff was very friendly consierge gave us great tips Location is fantastic and I would choose this hotel again .  Price Bathroom a bit dated but room and bed very comfy .  Nothing was too much trouble for the staff who were busy Extra pillows arrived within 5 mins The landing cupboard was a good idea help yourself to extra coffee tea blankets shampoo etc Love the toiletries not screwed to the wall .  We had problems with the first room we were given and it took 24 hours to resolve Not impressed with the response from reception customer facing staff The first room we were given had foul odour of damp and bathroom shower drain smelt very badly Upon reporting the smell the reception staff agreed to move us without question but the hotel was fully booked so we were told we had to wait 24 hours to be moved The reception staff were out of any other options solutions to the long wait other than suggesting a room spray which was frustrating More frustrating was that reception staff refused to come inspect the room despite our insistence Felt that the reception staff were not interested in understanding the problem or it s causes despite asking us to sit tight for 24 hours Once moved the second room was fine .  Hotel is located in very pleasant suburb but with quick and easy access to city centre Schonbrunn has some sights as well Hotel located close to U4 and trams Room had its own outdoor seating area overlooking courtyard which was very pleasant We had problems with the first room but the second was ok Impressions were that the rooms were fairly standard hotel rooms but nothing too remarkable Rooms were very quiet Good fast wi fi Hotel ballroom was a good entertainment space and catering was good Some of the portering staff went out of their way to help find us an ironing board due to lack of pressing service over weekends .  A bit noisy at night.  We were on our honeymoon and were upgraded and found lots of goodies in the room like champagne snacks and drinks I loved the robes and slippers and the shower was amazing Very cosy atmosphere in the room The staff couldn t do enough for us they were great .  Room dimly lit No free wi fi Odd sockets so not many places to charge phones etc had to phone reception and find an extension lead hidden in a cupboard Some noise from adjacent rooms.  Good location close to Royal Albert Hall for Proms .  Having to leave a bond of 200 with reception. No Positive.  The food of breakfast is the same everyday Not much choises and feel boring on the food after 2 days stay .  The location is very convenience to reach tube restaurants and shopping outlets . No Negative.  Great location. No Negative.  Hotel was good for value we didn t eat in the hotel Metro station near by Room were clean had a bath and shower combined We stayed in a standard room so the picture didn t look like the ones advertised Probably would stay again for the price we got it View was of a shared alley way not to pleasant but we didn t spend time in the room. No Negative.  Probably one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in Beds are gorgeously comfortable Decor exquisite .  Got to the hotel we booked and needed to be moved elsewhere We were not happy with the hotel we were moved to as a group and this review reflects that hotel the Montcalm . No Positive.  Only thing that was sad was that they were empty of the Ask Alfred teddy for the kids .  The kids felt so special at arrival and throughout our stay and that was the most important thing to me as it was their vacation The staff was super helpful and friendly We got free breakfast all three days and our single beds were put together to a kingsize bed with extra pillows so we didnt need a spare bed for the the youngest one Location was perfect just a short walk from the underground the museums we were going to and Diana memorial playground and much more Being so central in London you could think there would be much noise from the city but it was actually very peaceful and quiet This was our second stay here and we will certainly come back again .  Room shower would be better if detachable but I m being picky now .  Excellent meals and staff very polite and attentive Chosen as much for location as anything .  They didn t accomodate for the kids the breakfast was not nice we had slack cleaning service of our room.  Staff were lovely.  Rooms had new flooring renovated but odd musty or sewer type smells at hotel entrance a little in hallways also It did not impact our stay .  Friendly very helpful staff rooms nice size clean quiet A few blocks away f busy streets . No Negative.  excellent location and very helpful staff.  Noise coming from the fridge.  Room service was prompt.  nothing.  the hotel was very clean and tidy and the staff very presentable and friendly and helpful Also it was perfectly located for my stay in London.  nothing to dislike.  the position of the hotel the breakfast the staff the comfort all was excellent.  The room was a bit small but it was functional enough There are not enough plugs in the room so it was very hard to fix your hair while someone is using the bathroom and there are no slippers in the standart room so bring your own Other than that it was a great stay .  The location of the hotel is great Walking distance to everywhere and also it s next to the tram stop The staff is very friendly There is ironing room in the floor .  N.  N. No Negative.  I booked as a gift for my parents and they were delighted with the stay and pleased the hotel staff looked after them well .  Staff could be more friendly.  Facilities and room are good.  If you need parking book it in advance .  Very friendly staff Good sized rooms Great location Metro right outside Just off the Ramlas and Placa de Catalunya.  I asked for a double room at the time of reservation but we got a twin one instead The mini bar charge was more than what we consumed luckily I spotted this at checkout and it got fixed immediately 18 euro person day for breakfast is a bit unrealistic A bit too expensive from what it had to offer Room was a bit cold even with the heater maxed out I started to get weird unauthorized transactions with Travel reservation as a reference the day after the checkout and eventually had to cancel my card and get a new one Not sure if related to the hotel but it s the only place I used the card in question while in Amsterdam .  Staff was smiley and nice overall Location is great just a couple of blocks from the famous Rijksmuseum which was super handy The hotel was clean and the room was pretty spacious .  It was to far from everything not even a small convenience shop near by .  Bed was a bit hard.  The room had no small refrigerator. No Positive.  Nothing .  Beautiful hotel Loved how it felt very unique and Parisienne instead of just being in a chain hotel which could be anywhere Great room with a huge spa bath could even see Eiffel Tower from the bedroom window Great free wifi throughout the hotel Spa was fab Fresh flowers throughout the hotel which smelled amazing Fantastic traditional lift Hotel staff very accommodating and friendly they even keep plug adapters behind reception if you forget yours .  Room very small and very hot No A C .  Location and breakfast Decent shower. No Negative.  Great gym and sauna Very nice room Good desk to work at Good lighting Good bed and linnens Good breakfast . No Negative.  Location design cleanliness Hotel is very new very tasteful.  The shower in the room I got this time was not ideal The room was under the roof and so it wasn t possible in the shower to fully stand .  I ve stayed here more than once the experience is always very positive .  Better pricing of restaurant would have encouraged us to have breakfast there .  Clean efficient pleasant staff Not too noisy for city centre and close to everything .  Two days of room cleaning were missed of a 4 night stay resulting in my having to call reception and ask for the job to be completed There was a shortage of toilet paper on day 2 A rep came up to give me a half a roll as he couldn t find any more He was obviously embarrassed but did eventually came back sometime later with a complete roll One of the bathroom sink drains was blocked I had to request it be fixed It did get fixed There are areas that could afford repair The back patio has loose wooden tiles that should be fixed There is an accident waiting to happen Clearly some of the furniture is old and needs replacing or fixing The clothes drying rack in the washroom wasn t working and the staff said they weren t going to fix it The room was very small Little space for 2 people to put their clothes so we left them in the suitcase Overall the breakfast was good but the veggies were not fresh Some of the channels were not working CNN for example I reported the problem twice and nothing was done about it Staff was nice but I think they are stretched I don t blame them rather I put the responsibility on the management of Holiday Inn Your 4 star hotel rates a 3 at best We were hoping for more .  The staff was very friendly The location is very central The breakfasts is decent .  Rooms a little small than expected.  Location very good.  Breakfast.  Very good location 5 min from the Baker Street underground station Also bus station 3min from the hotel Friendly staff .  Rooms doors are very very bad It makes noisy sound like hell when it is closed .  Cleanliness is perfect Room is very good.  Nothing .  Excellent location for the Albert Hall and places to eat Stayed twice before and very good reliable level of comfort and service Quiet room with comfortable beds .  In need of an update.  Good Location.  Noise transmission from adjacent room .  Location Complimentary water and variety of options at breakfast.  Wifi was an issue Beer expensive.  Smart clean and stylish rooms Main bar also very good decor.  The hotel is a bit dated but has a good location Our carpets were ripped and coming off the floor he bathroom had a strange smell We were on the 7th floor and after a tiring day going around London all we needed was a good sleep only to be woken around 3 am by a drunk woman banging on someone else s door We rang reception who then came and got the woman out but she was back within half an hour which meant we didn t sleep thereafter The staff the next morning did not offer an apology and told us they were unaware this had happened We were given an email address to complain if we felt like it . No Positive. No Negative.  Availability of halal food Friendly attentive breakfast staff. No Negative.  All the staff were really friendly and genuine lovely food great room.  most things.  the experience was poor.  I was wrongly charged for a bottle of champagne and they didn t run through my bill with me at checkout .  Very comfortable room and helpful staff.  Rooms are relatively small.  Location is good.  Overpriced Gin Tonic 25 a glass is a bit excessive and I m used to Z rich prices 19 in a upscale bar . No Positive.  1 I was meant to be paying 79 but they charged me a extra 50 on arrival for a deposit they said would be returned the following day nothing has been returned nothing showed up in terms of the booking either 2 Location it says it Shoreditch yet its 15 20 mins walk away from Shoreditch and its actually Bethenal Green still 10 mins away from that tube stop also 3 The Hotel was advertised as a 4 Star yet the carpets in the room wasn t nice The TV s was portable s and didn t work The Bath was ok but the plug didn t work and hot water still come out when I ve turned it to cold 4 Lots of noise in the hotel and they did nothing to quieten down I m very annoyed customer who feels cheated.  Nothing. No Negative.  Hotel was located about a 20 minute walk from the Eiffel tower It was very close to a couple of metro stations and bus links The staff were exceptionally helpful .  Noisy cleaning staff in the morning Noisy air conditioning and generally disappointed with the hotel . No Positive. No Negative.  The apartments were excellent great location real value for money. No Negative.  comfortable bed good view.  The fact we could not stay longer.  Staff approachable and very friendly Excellent room service and quiet hotel bar with great bar staff.  Nice if there could be a comfortable chair in the room Small but I guess that is Paris .  Clean comfortable great location.  The bed had 2 mattresses which was uncomfortable for a young couple The shower head in the bathtub was too low for 6 1 feet person .  It is a small hotel with very clean and quiet rooms And friendly staff .  Pillows could be more comfortable.  Extremely friendly and welcoming staff well trained Nothing is a problem Good showers plugs next to mirrors so that you can dry your hair and ghd hairdryer .  The room was quite dark and the some of the lighting could have been better positioned .  Bed extremely comfortable excellent shower nice quiet room overlooking courtyard and very helpful and attentive staff It was fabulous having private access to the spa facilities .  toilet was a bit old looking.  convenience close to two Underground Stations and also Paddington station direct connect to Heathrow.  Our room temp was in the mid 80s when we checked in and it took the AC nearly 24 hrs running continuously to bring it to a manageable level Also surprised by the 10 different large cracks in the walls as the building has settled .  Breakfast setup was very good.  The bedrooms are quite small in proportion to the furnishings e g it was quite a squeeze getting around the bed and accessing the wardrobe but the room was beautifully decorated and the bathroom was spacious .  I was attracted to the originality and creativity of the design features and choices of contemporary artwork within the hotel Staff were really friendly and the breakfast was superb It was the ideal location for exploring the South Kensington museums and a very relaxing place to stay . No Negative.  Very clean and tidy great location in the city .  The noise in ground level rooms not great.  The wonderful team who worked there.  We did not like having to ask for the Daily Mail every day We also had to ask for a second chair and coffee table We would have liked the option of a quiet room traffic . No Positive.  Rooms are Parisian small and bathroom even smaller but it is something that you need to live with in Paris .  Perfect location and very helpful stuff I stayed twice already once for business and once with family weekend and in both cases it was a very good experience .  The next day after I ve used knife and vanity set had not been renewed .  Staffs are friendly Tasty breakfast .  The sticky toffee pudding was really a syrup sponge very nice but not sticky toffee More a comment than a complaint .  The staff where very friendly and helpful Very clean and no wait for the lift .  We didn t have any coffee in the room every type of tea and milk but I coffee. No Positive.  Did not appreciate a service charge being added to bar bill which also had a line for a gratuity With the exception of a great breakfast we dined out during our 4 day stay .  Ambience of refurbished central located historical hotel Walking distance to Big Ben Bell Tower Westminster Abbey Churchill War Rooms Encampment Subway Station Piccadilly Circus Trafalgar Square Thames River and much more .  would have preferred higher floor.  Break and bed was good.  No dinner available at the hotel but easy walk within 10 mins to local great restaurants although limited choice in area .  Compact room but clean with every amenity I required and in a lovely quiet location .  Breakfast not included in price very average room clean but old furnished.  Location wi fi.  All good.  Excellant hotel in great location. No Negative.  The added extras of sweet table.  Breakfast was OK but expensive for the choice and overall quality Toilet in the room was separate to the bathroom and was very small with no wash basin .  Staff very helpful quiet hotel despite being yards from the DLR station Room very clean bed was nice and comfortable nespresso machine was a nice touch .  This is definitely not a four star hotel according to European standard . No Positive.  I was attending a function at the O2 Arena and when I asked on the quickest way of getting there the front desk referred me to the taxi desk which was more expensive and struggled through traffic instead of just pointing to the cable cars station across the road . No Positive.  Disappointed short car park stay to offload luggage cost so much Would nit beat deal from booking com so got less margin when I booked though them.  Good location.  Considering the price expected more and it wasn t great being woken up at 6am to renovation work on the floor above Not sure I got the full benefit of the hotel facilities as they weren t fully explained to me Bar also shut early which was fine but no option offered for in room service .  Room great staff brilliant location perfect .  Could have done with a double bed and not twins.  Staff very helpful .  Location .  Staff very pleasant helpful .  Serve breakfast from 6am on a weekday. No Positive.  Problems with hot water supply.  Charming decor very friendly welcome .  The rooms and bathroom very tired.  The bedding.  I didn t stay here they switched me to the one across the road Park Grand London Hyde Park I wasn t too fussed but I could see that annoying some They re under the same umbrella though Shaftesbury I stayed a few weeks folks and it s a 5 min walk from Paddington station so I was thinking good base and it s so easy to get to I stayed in a deluxe single room now yes it s small but I m not a big person so it was fine for me Bed was comfy and the TV was in a good spot on the wall opposite Bathroom is tinyyyyy the shower is very narrow but great pressure I grew used to it but ended up leaving the bathroom door open every time I showered just me so it didn t matter Criticism would be no shelf for your toiletries there is one directly above the toilet but that s just odd There s no iron or hairdresser in the room and the bar fridge concealed in the desk isn t plugged in The lifts didn t go to my room so it was up two very narrow staircases to it The porter took my case up and down upon check out as it was 25kg and I would ve struggled Put bluntly a massive unit wouldn t do so well in a single room from my understanding the rooms aren t that big anyway but maybe pick a double incase There was room for my suitcase near the desk and I just shoved any shopping or my backpack in front of the window The doors are so loud when they shut Only annoyed me on my last two nights due to new next door neighbours constantly slamming theirs at night The corridors smelt a bit musty but it s an old hotel done up not too badly Overall it wasn t too bad I could see people bulking at the size it is essentially a biggish shoe box but was still doable when I was able to catch up with my man for a few hours haha It ain t 4 stars though No way But hardly a hovel .  Comfy bed Good tv Staff made up rooms every day and always replaced linen Porters very helpful So close to Paddington station Hyde Park Kensington Gardens I even walked to Harrods in Knightsbridge Air con unit right above your bed good if you like a fan noise to fall asleep useful in blocking out neighbouring noise .  The only issue is localisation Reaching the nearest U Bahn station takes about 15 minutes .  Great staff very good facilities Room is clean and tidy Generally for this price in Vienna hotel is simply outstanding Quiet and green neighbourhood .  Surrounding area was a little grim after dark however the metro was right outside so that could be avoided .  Location was ideal and staff were easy to communicate with The view from my room on the 7th floor was gorgeous .  We had requested parking but upon arrival the garage was being renovated We had to park on the street about a block away .  Easy to get to Shonbrunn palace and metro to Vienna on the bus Not hard to find.  Nothing.  The quirkiness.  Clenliness could be much better Beds were not that comfortable as could be expected from a hotel The room we had was quite small and cupboards were OK for a one night stay only Sound isolation is bad One can hear discussions and TV in the neighboring room When the door of the next room closes one is immediately completely awake .  Very friendly and helpful staff Centrally located .  I wish breakfast was included in the price .  Free wine and tapa service at 5 was good Insulation of the hotel was perfect Despite the busy street and construction works across we never heard a noise Perfect location was a bonus .  Nothing all good.  The customer service was great.  small bathroom room a little dated no view.  location parking staff was friendly and helpful.  Only two powdered milks in the bedroom .  Very comfortable Only five minutes from the Metro Station. No Negative.  Everything. No Negative.  staff were great. No Negative.  Place.  Get my own coffee refills but staff was very attentive.  Breakfast and daily snack selections were terrific As was upper balcony and entire staff Great experience in great location Felt like home .  Hous keeping.  Location and staff both are great.  Room small AC has no auto so u chose cold or hot which bothers me a lots .  Good but less than my expectations .  When I asked the concierge if I can smoke in the balcony they told me I can t smoke while in the corner of balcony you can see a lot of cigarettes stumps .  The location.  Small details needing attention e g shower rail loose hairs on bed .  Very friendly and helpful staff.  Hotel is to warm and to noisy traffic .  Bed and breakfast were okay.  In room dining services needs improvement .  The Reception and Concierge Staff is very helpful and friendly but in room dining services needs improvement .  There was a rotten fruit in the fruits basket Not much amenities inside of the hotel such as pool or gym .  The mobile phone handy was very helpful for us since we didn t have local phone The bed was also very comfy that I slept well very much .  Hard to find .  Very clean . No Negative.  Great location lovely hotel. No Negative.  Very friendly staff room very clean and spacious Great location for the o2 Arena one stop on the tube Highly recommended.  Bedside lighting was poor and did not facilitate reading in bed Shower did not drain and water overflowed into rest of bathroom .  Welcoming and helpful Reception staff comfortable rooms and excellent breakfast .  Bedroom very small so that you had to edge around the bed though bathroom was a good size Fittings a little worn e g handheld shower head base came away from bath scuffed and slightly old areas in bathroom Also provided bathrobes and slippers but were quite low quality so may be best not to provide .  Great location right in the heart of Marylebone very close to shops and lots of places to eat and within walking distance of all the attractions A very clean room provided shampoo etc Very comfortable and large bed Happy for us to leave our luggage on the last day .  To be honest 42 per Person for breakfast is absoltely not acceptable .  Balcony with a great view over Amsterdam.  gym with old equipment also spa a bit old .  nice rooms .  The bedroom itself needed a bit of updating the bathroom was very modern which highlighted the need for the bedroom to be modernised .  The location was excellent and the roof terrace was stunning an oasis away from the busy city with incredible views . No Negative.  Friendly welcome great views from 14th floor.  Nothing in particular .  Just what I needed for a 2 night stay .  bit scruffy in part and room rather small.  Fresh sheets clean bathroom hotel bar and very very very helpful front of house staff and nice bartender .  Maybe the option to have basic food options toasties paninis etc .  Stayed here before Fantastic hotel prime location really good facilities with helpful and friendly staff .  Bery small room bathroom Considering it it should be a 4 star hotel i was disappointed by the breakfast offered.  Friendly staff location.  Discrepancy between online booking price and hotel records which took a while to sort .  Friendly staff Swimming pool Fabulous restaurant for dinner.  nothing .  booked this for my hubby and brother to stay as they were going to a gig hubby loved it said it was very posh would defo stay again excellent value for money .  Room service breakfast Tepid and scrambled eggs horrible Hard and like it had been standing around for a while Late room service.  Location.  Wifi was a bit patchy so Netflix on their smart TV was stop start but hey we weren t in town to watch TV so a minor issue.  Our second stay here as regular visitors to the city we like to get out of the centre and explore areas the natives hold dear Jordaan is a gem for this Big rooms great bed we had a terrace too A great stay .  the gym is really big and seems new from my last visit but there are no weights and the precor machines are not great they could use a fitness consultant to set up the gym properly we ate two breakfasts and a dinner in the restaurant and it too needs some work i can always tell how a breakfast will be by the quality of the orange juice and this is no exception line is 7 deep in the morning for the coffee machines they need to either have a filter coffee option or buy 1 or 2 more machines some fish would be good for breakfast and something made fresh omelettes or waffles and change it up a bit there is a lot of other choices but i would say less is more in this case have a few great things the croissants are amazing for example and not 16 types of bread austrian food is normally great but the chicken salad was overcooked and not very tasty service is spotty these are two areas that can be easily improved but would not stop me from coming back again .  the room was excellently designed and appointed we had a suite perfect for kids great sauna area location is really good right near a nice museum and schonbrunn it was reasonably priced and the best comparative option for us very happy with my choice .  The cold room with cold air conditioning and when we called a member of staff to help the instructions were not clear regarding how to work it The staff member should have physically helped us with the air conditioning instead of giving my partner unclear instructions .  The location was close to the station The pastries were nice.  everything.  nothing. No Negative.  Friendly staff Nice room.  Very small room and bathroom.  Location.  No air conditioning in the room not all rooms are equipped with air con For a summer stay it was a bit uncomfortable due to the heat They provide electric fans though Do ask when you reserve If you travel with a car parking is difficult The hotel doesn t have its own parking .  The staff was very hospitable Very polite and attentive to your needs The kitchen is well equipped They have what you need for cooking Ingredients can be bought at stores located at walking distance from the hotel .  Very small room and too hot.  Location. No Negative.  One of the best hotel Staff are always there to help concierge and reception I wish I have membership at the hotel .

We had 3hours lovely Walk from the Shiphall airport use a bycicle road to Occura Hotel asked Hotel by telephone on possibility to walk answer was to take a taxi The view from executive lounge and possibility open the window in the room we rented bycicles thanks to Sofi from hotel reception we got them for free at check in we got upgraded for one night we booked for two nights at different rates with the same room and access lounge also we got an access to business lounge till 18h check out was at 12h Stuff helped and cooperated in everything Thanks to house keeper my jeans were dry in 30 min .  The only thing that i possibly could pick on was that it wasnt completely apparent that the front door of the hotel was actually the front door .  This was a fantastic hotel experience true London class and luxury . No Negative.  Breakfast buffet was amazing and service was impeccable . No Negative.  People and food and hotel all to a high standard.  Nothing .  I can t imagine that there is a better mid priced hotel in Milan The building doesn t look like much on the outside but inside it is just about perfect The quiet rooms are simply but beautifully designed with excellent lighting windows that open and divinely comfortable bed and bedding Our room had a spotless marble bathroom with robes and slippers towel warmer and large towels as well as excellent amenities replenished everyday There were complimentary mineral water and an espresso machine on the desk as well as chocolates on the nightstand stand The staff is extremely knowledgeable and helpful excellent English at reception And the breakfast included with our room was vast good European and Anglo choices All this just steps from the Duomo and Galleria with a metro stop around the corner and trams and buses a few steps away Tip the Atypical Bar two doors away recommended to us by reception staff is a find It offers the wonderful Milan custom of apertivo a drink and all you can eat from buffet of antipasti stew roast meat rice and a sweet for ten euros inclusive If you arrive tired and are not up for dinner late as the Italians eat it fancy restaurants don t open until 8 Bar Atypical is a great solution .  To eat go a couple of blocks away from Gracia Better food for less money At hotel request or book an out side room We had an inside room with a window on a mine shaft with light from above.  Location staff. No Negative.  Amazing locations with the best bars theatres and restaurants in Soho walking distance from the hotel .  Felt like we were put in the cheap rooms Certainly not like the pictures Breakfast was hit and miss Very busy if you try to eat at 9am queued for 15 mins Had to get up and eat before getting ready at 8am however they didn t have enough cutlery Always had to ask for spoons knives and cups Not enough staff to clear tables Pancakes scarce Right next to rer metro work being carried out obviously not hotels fault but be aware Could hear trains late in the evening and early morning when in bed .  Good location right next to rer and metro Children s entertainer was a nice touch .  The room was awful overlooking a grimy backyard and roof Could not swing a cat around in the bathroom but have dealt with this direct with Customer Relations Officer at The Waldorf .  The dining area was good no complaints about the food.  Littered neighbourhood quite small parking spaces especially when you have something more than mid size.

There was dried blood on one of our pillows We ordered fresh orange juice for room service to our room and it was watery cheap orange squash We had to call down to reception to request dressing gowns and slippers and then when they came the material was cheap and scratchy and smelt like laundry bleach Also the valet car park is extortionate at 24 it s better to park at nearby Westfield for 9 However to the hotels credit it was a lovely staff member that told us that information.  The hotel is beautifully appointed The decor and furnishings are beautiful The shower pressure is nice and firm and the enclosed wet room in the bathroom is a nice touch The staff were very friendly and they upgraded us for free .  the wifi does not work well There is no water cooker no coffee in the room for such rate I asking for doulbe bed but I got only 2 single bed Staff always said no if I ask for something That is most expensice and bad hotel I stay in Barcelona ever .

Great place Just a quick taxi ride to the main city Awesome hotel with helpful staff Very clean and free wifi A C Only bad part was the restaurant in the hotel very poor service and pretty gross food.

The view was amazing The best part and great location .  Everything. No Positive.  No breakfast included.

Whilst we didn t use it the room service menu was limited .  Perfectly located in a quiet area over looking the park and around the corner from Holborn Underground station Staff friendly welcoming and helpful Rooms clean and nicely decorated Liked the dark patterned duvet covers rather than the usual hospital like white that is more the norm for hotels now Great having plastic bottles and water machines on each floor as well as the complimentary hot drinks and biscuits at reception .

No Negative.  The hotel is great with pleasant and relaxing atmosphere It is not absolutely perfect it had small downsides but they are doing all their best to satisfy guests and to make their staying comfortable carefree We have to admit very professional and helpful staff don t believe to German guests who write stupidities about staff they are always unhappy unsatisfied by everything in the world .  The Nespresso machine was in the room which is great but there was no capsules The cabinet had no hangers to hang the clothes The was some noise even when the windows are closed .  Very supportive staff We checked in late at 9pm and we were surprised that we were upgraded to a better bigger room .  The rooms are very clean.  Staff are very friendly.  Queueing for 30 mins at breakfast unacceptable No apologies from staff Waiters hard to find and rude They couldn t cope with the volume of clients and it appears they were disorganised and short staffed .  Unfortunately I had to complain about the service received at breakfast However the guest relations manager did upgrade our room for free as a gesture of good will which made the stay better. No Negative.  Right in the buzz of the city.  No single thing that warrants criticism .  Staff very helpful and made guests feel welcome Excellent selection at breakfast .  Very small room No locker on the bathroom door.  Location.  When we arrived the receptionist was not very helpful even though one of us speaks fluent Spanish We d reserved breakfast and a parking place and the receptionist struggled to give us either On the other hand when we checked out on Sunday the great receptionist was able to refund us the breakfast we missed due to sleeping too late She also made sure we could leave our car in the parking for a bit longer .

Close to Westfield and underground Nice rooms friendly staff .  The breakfast was a little pricey at 20 per person.  The pillows were very comfy.  A very small negative that the room assigned wasn t ready when I went up It was spotted by concierge and told I could get another room but there was no rush on my part .  Every single member of staff were helpful and friendly It had an incredibly warm atmosphere and the rooms so cosy Great Front of House but walking to my room housekeeping so polite and welcoming too .  We did nt mind walking over a mile to the overcrowded center of town to get on the tour busses We liked returning from a day trip and getting back to a quiet more residential area to spend our evenings Some people may want the convenience of being in town .  Good area to walk around Good restaurants nearby Fortunately a staff member from our Princes cruise ship was in the lobby to help us make arrangements for sightseeing tours and transfered us to the ship at the end of our stay .  Rooms very tired and need attention .  The staff overall are fantastic and well and truly compensate for the minor downsides . No Negative.  Perfectly located at central London and tube station.  the elavator.  Wonderful hotel and service from all aspects .  Too small breakfast room Burnt bacon for breakfast Fresh orange juice only if you pay Not enough chocolate croissant for each guest only a few pieces each morning Rolls in poor quality Very dark floors Stairs on entrance very unusual for 4 stars hotel .  Location Bed quality Clean bedlinen .  We found the bed a little to firm for us but that is the only thing and it s only personal preference .  Very friendly and helpful staff. No Negative.

Drawers in Wardrobes.  Staff Service.  The room was very small but nice Due to the size of the hotel bar services and similar is not available but there are many rstaurants and bars nearby .  Peaceful area next to the park cosy and beautifully decorated little hotel in a victorian villa Only few minutes walking way to Earl s Court .  Room rate.  Very nice hotel location Over priced.  Was disappointed that we didn t have facilities to make a cup of tea in the room And the bathroom was on the small side .  Location was perfect for access to the old town of Vienna Breakfast the odd evening meals we had were very good excellent choice . No Negative.  We like the fact that NH hotels are consistently good The brand is very reliable meaning the staff are always courteous and efficient the rooms spacious and the breakfast surpasses all expectations far beyond anything I have encountered worldwide Many thank yous for a great stay and all the effort that goes into making your successful hotels .  the stale smell is awful in the corridors and passage ways to the rooms on the 6th floor .  location cleanless.  Nearest tram about 15 mins walk.  Room service balcony quietness of hotel. No Negative.  Lovely room lovely common areas The staff are exceptionally friendly and accommodating .  food and cocktails have gone down hill unfortunately I would rate 10 10 but hotel is let down massively by below average food and drinks for a 5 star hotel you would expect a much higher standard of food drinks cocktails are poor champagne cocktails served with flat cava a lot of the food was obviously cooked earlier in the day .  the superior room is phenomenal it s like living in your own apartment bathroom is excellent beds are super comfortable staff very helpful Location is great for las ramblas and gothic district beach is a 15 minute walk taxi queue right outside the hotel and never have to wait for a taxi free hotel slippers free wifi .  Awful room awful service at front desk can t begin to explain how poor this hotel is Have stayed in better hotel ibis .  Location. No Negative.  The receptionist staff were very helpfull in every possiple way They gave us a quick hints about Milan since it was our first time My wife liked the cookies and croissants in the reception . No Negative.  Everything was perfect.  The essential net curtains and carpet weren t the cleanest .  A great location very central Welcoming helpful staff we had a room on the first floor which meant only one flight of stairs and the manager carried our bags for my daughter and I The room was small and along with the bathroom is somewhat dated with dark furniture but it was quite acceptable The fan was welcome as it was hot when we stayed This hotel is very good value for money which is its best asset just a few minute s walk from Oxford Street Marble Arch and Marylebone Road Recommended .  We booked the room with the view Got the room with no view but it did not matter because hotel never bothered to tell us that they are in the midst of renovation of facade Hotel was covered in schafolding and protective netting so you couldn t see a view anyway .  Location was superb Walking distance to everything. No Negative.  All the staff were great and very welcoming The design of the interior looked abit quirky in the online photos then we arrived and saw for ourselves and we loved it . No Negative.

Clean room plus empty the bins.  Nothing.  The travel advisory around town was off a couple of times Otherwise nothing to complain about Don t go by the little drab business hotel type exterior as it s quite nice inside and visitors are a good mix of families and travellers .  Location is very convenient just a block away from the beach and near to some very nice eating joints and short ride to city centre Staff quite polite and well maintained pool gym steam and sauna Breakfast spread was nice Overall good value for money .  Nothing.  Bed extra comfy. No Negative.  Central but not on main drag Wonderful ambience .  I think they need to figure out the horse smell issue on the street Perhaps bleach the street nightly or use a citrus solution that is non toxic I can see this being the only issue in the hot summer .  I wish I could have stayed longer because they had so many free things 4 free bottles of wine plenty of bottled water and little cake treats when I arrived The bed was amazing and the cleaning staff was excellent Lastly the front desk reception helped me tremendously with food reservations .  Cleanliness could be a bit better.  The hotel is nice and good value for money staff are cheerful especially in the restaurant reception.  Nothing.  The hotel born was actually over booked but they contacted me to say they can put us in there sister hotel the Cathedral born this was superb .  toiletries not replenished daily.  Great location.  Wi fi was working relatively poor throughout the hotel required reloading web pages for a few times ok ish to check the mail but not suitable for any business remote access facilities.  Location helpful staff breakfast.  The.  Rooms were very good and clean Even comes with free cable TV. No Negative.  Staff were amazing very helpful and welcoming .  My general opinion is that this hotel is like a 3 stars Hotel in Germany The mold in the corners of the bathtub and in the corners of the shower was the only thing that bothered us The room was cleaned every day but the mold will not go away just with a vacuum cleaner .  The Hotel is situated near Bus Station estacio de Nord and near Arc de Triumph metro station 12 min away walking distance from La Sagrada Familia The personal is friendly and the breakfast was quite tasty It was quite cheap 60 Euro night and for Barcelona is a very low price . No Negative.  The staff is professional and helpful The room is comfortable and well decorated I really enjoy the fresh orange juice in the breakfast and coffee in the mini bar everyday .  Staff was acting more like detectives and less like receptionists They were questioning if I used my own credit card I had to show them the card and even then they had a hard time believing I could actually own that card Not sure what the whole issue was about When they found out that i was alone even though I had booked for two people they removed the towels from the bathroom I found that hilarious Number 1 because the towels are miniature towels they don t offer bath towels Number 2 what does it matter since i paid for the room for two people They started questioning why I booked for two if i was alone I informed them that I always use the same setting on www booking com Besides taking the towels they never checked if there were any tissues or toilette paper so I had to call in the middle of teh night to ask them to bring them The receptionist answered please call back at 7 am when the staff is here Well since i had an early flight I had to insist Overall if I don t take the Austrian hospitality into account I had an average stay in an average hotel The interactions were comical . No Positive.  If there was better food.  Loved the location.  There was nothing to dislike.  We liked everything about this hotel from its unique d cor to the wonderful staff It is out of the centre of Barcelona but only 200 metres from a Metro station tram stop and in a quiet area The staff were most helpful and booked tours for us The breakfast offered an amazing choice of foods The metro to the city centre was swift and the stations in fact the whole city are very clean we loved the hotel and the city of Barcelona.  The basement room very claustrophobic .  We were ok when we were moveed out of the room with no windows not used to that. No Negative.  Staff were really friendly helpful and cheerful Although compact the room was clean and had everything needed .  French staff dun speak English not helpful The lamp was out of order no one fix it for four days Not very clean room .  Location good. No Negative.  Great service.  THE ROOMS ARE WAY TOO SMALL AND UNCOMFORTABLE Increase size of rooms an of breakfast room facilities .  The people working their were great The location is very central and good als o given the price of the room. No Negative.  Great location Service was brilliant Overall super hotel.  Time to time water in the bathroom was only lukewarm to cold to take a shower . No Positive.  People talking loud late at night in the corridor.  Staff very nice and customer service oriented Great location Christmaq decoration and gorgeous stairs .  Old and small room Small lobby.  Location and cordial staff.  Breakfast needs fresh fruit not canned Need to be able to make toast A better selection of foods is needed .  Lovely room very clean .  The beds are not comfortable .  Good breakfast . No Negative.  Very modern and innovative design Not like any chain hotels Loved it .  Breakfast area is too small When choosing Breakfast you have to be prepared to get knocked into .  friendly and helpful staff very bright and cheerful Hotel.  Check in was very slow had to pay for a upgrade to a room with a window Wifi the staff in the pizza restaurant were not very welcoming .  Room was comfortable but dated .  old decor everything is brown coloured every door every wardrobe .  beds amazing nice bar area very close walk to everything. No Negative.  Great location Great breakfast Spacious room Attentive staff .  Wanted to charge us an extra 20 pounds for one hour late check out .  Breakfast was good Bed was very comfortable.  Nothing.  Location was great and all the staff we met were friendly and helpful I would not hesitate to stay here again when visiting Vienna . No Negative.  Staff were always ready to help Hotel was great in terms of atmosphere and comfort especially with two teenagers Rooms are bright and well equipped and our rooms had a great view down the Lane it is a fantastic location for shopping sightseeing and theatre but at heart of the business centre so we were all catered for Customer service by managers was superior to most of the other hotels we have stayed in in London.  This was a very late booking done online only 2 3 hours before our arrival at around 10 30pm but I would have expected that once booking was made that our room should have been prepared for us On entering the bottom corridor that led to our ground floor club twin room 018 it felt very cold and unfortunately the room itself was freezing The heating system didn t seem to throuw out any heat when turned on and then we found a plug in oil filled heater radiator which heated up but the room was so cold I wanted to get into bed to get changed The beds too were really cold the room felt like it had not been used in a long time Further evidence of this was a big cobweb coming down from the ceiling and joining to the scatter cushion on my bed So we went to bed very cold and then woke at 4 am as the room was then too warm with the oil heater on so turned it off If the room beds had been warmed and aired prior to arrival I m sure we would have been happy Didn t stay for breakfast so can t give any opinion on food but the staff on reception were curteous and polite and apologised for the complaint about the room temperature when we checked out I should have complained when we first arrived but we were tired from journey and had an early morning start so we probably wrongly just put up with it No view from room in morning we realised that we looked out onto a blind alley we had asked for an upper floor room but as I said it was a late booking .  Location easy walking distance to Paddington station underground. No Negative.  Staff extremely friendly and breakfast was rich .  Not a good place to stay with a small kid no transportation is being provided from airport and vice versa house cleaning is not upto the mark the kitchen utensils were never cleaned properly towels were never changed regularly.  The location is not very far from the airport the staffs are helpful and cordial both the restaurants are good and provide fresh foods.  In the middle of nowhere extremely overpriced dirty small room.  Nothing.  The bed was like a plank.  Lovely area very kind staff gorgeous hotel.  The price tricky I came to know that I have to pay City Tax in the last minute for 4 people we paid 80 euro for 4 days that is rip off.  Location and the staff 2 Things I like more.  The bathroom especially the toilet was really dirty There was no information material about the hotel s facilities in the room There was no wardrobe in the room only shelves We ordered breakfast with roomservice The first morning it came the second day it didn t come There was a kettle in the room with teabags and coffee but not one single teaspoon or anything else to stir the coffee with There was only one extra pillow in the room which was a double room There was a minibar but it was empty The room was also really small .  Nothing.  No bar as renovating should have been told before we arrived .  Staff were very friendly.  room temperature control view from room was not inviting.  Room was very clean comfortable bathroom spacious.  A little bit more detailed cleaning of the room .  Room location variety of supermarkets nearby and close transport stations .  The hotel stay was overpriced The breakfast was budget in terms of the ingredients used and not alot was on offer Definitely wasnt worth 13 50 The remote and phone in our room was dusty The hotel looks very plush on the hotside but not well maintained on the inside with the elevator smelling of cigarette Also the parking 21 for 24 hours are they going to wash it too I would not stay again at all as I dont think I got value for money whatsover The gym is 4 a session too .  We liked the location As the location was good for the event we attended . No Negative.  Everything was perfect .  The rooms are a bit aged and need renovation.  Location Good wifi Polite staff. No Negative.  Some rooms too small hot and stuffy The hotel was happy to change our room after an uncomfortable sleeples night The room we were moved to was a lot better .  There was nothing I didn t like I would definitely stay at The Queens Gate in the future .  The ambience and decor of the hotel The staff were very helpful and welcoming The location was superb Very impressed with the breakfast The room was very comfortable bathrobe and slippers provided .  The booking com driver dropped us at the wrong Bilderberg hotel even though we told him it looked nothing like the photo on the website.  The location staff were great.  The old room on the 5th floor are terrible and not price worthe it Howcome its the same pruce for ghe new renovated room on the 15 th floor.  The new room on 15 floor is excellent however the one on 5 floor was terrible How come is the price for both is the same My rating based on the new rooms on 15 floor My rating for 5 floor would be terrible and very bad.  Being charged 9 00 for 2 small bottles of water.  Amazing breakfast .  There was no outdoor sign to identify the hotel We actually stood in the entry way to get protection from the rain that was coming down as we searched for our hotel We wandered around a two block area before realizing we had been right outside it The room configuration was a bit unusual but that is a minor issue .  Location was really close to the historic sites that we were walking to Staff spoke multiple languages and were quick to recommend restaurants and shopping in the area Nice clean place .  Internet service.  Staff service cleanliness. No Negative.  Amazing localisation You get room service and the staff is always trying to help whenever they can There are a lot of restaurants close by as well as the metro .  Room was a bit run down.  Nice vibe.  Nothing in particular that we didn t dislike .  Room was very good with a modern facilities and a comfortable bed Close to transport and to suburban shopping centre eating facilities . No Negative.  the location everything is near by foot or by bus .  The room was tiny If you are 6ft or taller you would not be able to fit in the bed And for over 100 a night you would hope for somewhere to put your bag other than on or under the bed The bed was right up against the window which was single glazed and right next to a busy junction meaning I got a very poor nights sleep . No Positive.  Nothing not to like.  Nice big bed toiletries provided and tea coffee in room Good free wifi coverage too.

Good central location Good breakfast Room was small but comfortable .  Breakfast was OK The fruit was awful but the rest was edible .  Room was nice It was a good size especially for a big city hotel bed was very comfortable No AC so it was a little hot but there was a fan The hotel is very centrally located so we walked to everything There are lots of nice restaurants and pubs right around the corner Plus it is in the Theater district so if you had tickets to a show you could walk to it .  Nothing at all .  Very friendly and professional staff Lovely welcoming vibe and feel to the hotel We had our room upgraded free of charge The rooms and all public areas were exceptionally clean The location of the hotel is fantastic Quite simply the best hotel my wife and I have stayed in at London .  No view from room looking over to other rooms.  Nice big room Love the fresh flowers in the public areas Views from south side of Thames great.  Only complaint is we asked for an iron and it never came Had to ask again and that time they brought it to the room Very minor complaint given the rest of the experience at this hotel The location is great to get around the city but Champs Elysees doesn t offer many great affordable food choices within walking distance Most of the restaurants cafes are either outrageously expensive or not very good Suggest researching and venturing out of the area for that .  Excellent stay Location was great for sight seeing and right near a subway station making it easy to get around the city Person at the front desk was lovely and upgraded us to a deluxe room free of charge The bed was incredibly comfortable Hotel is nice and seemed very clean .  Noisy noisy noisy Our room was in major city road all night trams police ambo sirens motorbikes then street cleaners Might as well have slept in train station Perhaps there are quieter rooms make sure you ask for one Had early checkin noon confirmed by email from Booking com but surly front desk said you can ask but you do not get so not a great start Had to wait 2 5 hours to checkin Hotels need to be reminded their first contact can determine the tone for your whole stay .  leaving.

The room was hot and there was no air conditioning so you had to open the window which was noisy .  Good breakfast selection and attentive waiting staff .  The room was very small and the room s only window looked out to an even smaller square space with a huge a ventilator pipe The bed also sucks you into the middle so it was not the most comfortable unfortunately .  Very convenient location walking distance to Hyde Park Beautiful lobby helpful professional and friendly staff and the interior of the room was great too I booked the place very last minute but didnt encounter any problems at all .  Breakfast wasn t that good elevator was so small.

Charging my card on a reception desk at arrival to the hotel after I already payed in advance the room Somebody don t trust me Come on you have my adress my number of card already so don t make some pressure unnecessary It would be nice to have lemon slices for the tea by the hot tea water boiler Breakfast could be better for the 5 stars hotel .  The suit was wonderfull Every detail was superb I liked it very much The position of the hotel was perfect for me as I went on ice skating at the Rathaus Eistraum I ll come back for sure .  The tile grouting needs attention as does the scuffed paintwork They no longer accept checks but I think they meant cheques .  The staff we very helpful and nothing was too much trouble .  That our stay wasn t longer .  Beds were very comfy Staff very professional and attentive .  Generally dreary .  Near the tube .

Only bad thing was a slightly cold entree on room service.  Friendly and welcoming front desk staff Great location and easy access They take feedback seriously and act on it They even followed me up after my stay.  The receptionist did not advise us that there was a shuttle available to the airport . No Positive.  Because the reception is in the top of the building we needed to go the top and then come down to enter the room .  Great view over the Ij Easy and reliable way to reach Amsterdam Centraal by tram near the hotel . No Negative.  The hotel was amazing Very stylish and modern The staff was really very friendly The room was clean and beautiful .  Overpriced drinks throughout the hotel especially the mini bar 7 for small water and more for Coke etc When it says breakfast included in price that s if you just want pastries and tea Not a buffet and extras again are vastly overpriced .  Location to all the main sights in Paris .  parking fees.  location.  The price The way when they tried to convince me to book directly instead of using booking or any other website They charge more in the last day and they say it s VAT while the VAT is included as it shows in the booking page .  The location.  I had to go home .  Everything was amazing loved the ceiling fan in the room This spoiled American appreciated that And so close to the train station getting to and from Expo 2015 was a breeze .  Nothing to dislike.  The staff were very helpful and friendly.  Better hairdryer the hairdryer away never matches upto your own I m glad I packed my own .

No coffee facilities in room Decor tired Over crowded communal areas Bathrooms small and not seperate from room Lots of boozey guests Need taxi to get to any shop or restaurant outside hotel.  Room views Good for stag parties.  I expect a 4 star hotel to change bed linen daily or at least on alternate days In my 3 nights stay I basically had to sleep in wrinkled damp sheets .  Great location in an interesting neighborhood Chinatown which offers excellent options for eating out Park Sempione and the castle Sforza are just 5 mins walk away To go any further tram 12 10 stop right on a parallel street and take you to the historic center Also being a bit away from tram tracks offers quietness and good rest at night .  Nothing .  Everything was perfect I can t wait to go back to Barcelona and will definitely be staying at Hotel Barcelona Catedral again . No Negative.  Our room was very quiet.  We asked for double bed and had 2 single beds. No Positive.  House keeping needs more improvement you have to ask twice .  Location is perfect and hotel design was really nice.  I understand that room rates are high in this part of London and that One Aldwych is a very high standard hotel with 24hr room service but I felt that it wouldn t be too much to ask for tea and coffee making facilities in the room and that breakfast items were very expensive even compared to the restaurant dinner prices However the pub across the road serves an excellent breakfast at less eye watering prices .  High level of service and comfort throughout the hotel.  Bathroom wasnt very clean For breakfast wasnt vegetables .  Staff was very flexible We had problem with the room size and room was very cold Staff changed us to new bigger warm comfortable room We were very happy Breakfast nice .  room a little chilly.

Loved our room on the 6th floor which overlooked the street Loved how quiet it was Loved the comfortable bed and the decor of the room. No Negative.  The location all the staff we came in contact with The room was spotless and breakfast was lovely .  Sometimes we didn t get a refill of shampoo etc The bed was too soft and the pillows were useless I had to shove 2 pillows into one case just to get any support .  The staff were friendly and helpful The free breakfast was awesome .  Just not the standard you d expect for What I paid I ve stayed at better budget hotels with free unlimited wifi and better options and breakfast Will stay at a travelodge next time .  The bed was comfy . No Negative.  The staff at breakfast were genuinely welcoming and very efficient and good food makes all the difference making a Ok stay to a great stay We will use the Hotel again for our next visit .  Humidity in the bathroom all the time water under the door toilet and shower Very slow to no wifi maybe temporary Quality foods drinks rooftop bar.  location close to the sea Short taxidrive to the centre.  No restaurant in hotel I have been in better Mercure hotels and paid less .  Plenty of restaurants close by .  But a bit out of the way to the central part of Barcelona an hour by metro to The Gothic Quarter There were very loud people next to us that came back in the middle of the night The walls are very thin .  Comfortable and clean Close to the airport Very nice staff Always had water and apples for us at reception .  Free car parking is limited to a small area of the car park arrive early double room with a sofa bed can be quite cramped when sofa bed is folded out .  Very clean very comfy bed and VERY friendly staff Located 5 minute walk from DLR station last DLR is before 1am after that get take a night tube from Central London to Mile End then take a cab from there back to the hotel under 5 miles .  Room size was ok but the standard room was dark looking out at the centre building Note if your kids are under 5 they can t use the pool at any time .  Great location just off Oxford Road Reasonable sized bath.  not coffee machine despite having a kitchenette kettle instant coffee it s eye wateringly expensive.  fab location lots of character and charm while being clean and comfortable staff super helpful.  The size of the room for the price No cupboard space ironing facilities But cool and trendy .  The location is perfect Hotel is funky and the roof top bar is a good feature .  The club lounge is too small.  Friendly staff and helpful.  Bathroom nowhere to put toiletries.  Comfy bed.  I found the solution of parking very expensive 40 per 24 hours is a lot of money .  I liked very much the design of the hotel small and nicely designed and executed I am an architect and a contractor so I inspect good quality very easily in a supper good location clean nice basic l can say only good things . No Negative.  Location hotel facilities excellent breakfast .  The bathroom is in the bedroom and has a glass door so using the shower after someone is sleeping in the bedroom kids or baby in crib is disturbing due to the light coming into the bedroom .

No Negative.  Exclusive hotel nicely decorated in art deco style with very good SPA facilities and ideal localization for business meeting as well as sightseeing Very good restaurant with rich breakfast where everyone can find something for himself Generally personnel is very helpful and kind Hotel worth recommendation .  Limited restaurant menu.  Very complete and very good breakfast. No Negative.  Perfect facilities Perfect breakfast I never experienced this facilities in Paris and Italy even in 5 star hotels .  At the time of booking via booking com I was particularly attracted by 5 rating you have there and hence I was eager to pay a premium given that this was going to be a very special night for me and my wife after a very long and difficult period when I had to be in hospital Upon arrival we were greeted professionally and though we had to queue for reception I found the member of staff working well However we were quite disappointed when we went up to the room where we did not find essentials like toothbrushes or toothpaste which would be a norm even in a 3 hotel Later on we realised there was only an empty box of tissues We wanted to use Internet on TV but the keyboard did not work We reported it to the reception and it took a member of staff over half an hour to come to us and change batteries by which time we did not need the keyboard Later it happened that the bondage I have on my neck leaked and we asked for a firs aid kit plasters and cotton pads These were brought to us 15min later no scissors which we asked to bring and they cam another half an hour later and we were asked to return half empty Asda plaster pack when we finished This again did not look particularly 5 to me We asked for a large bottle of water paid and were said that you don t serve water in large bottles I appreciate you are trying to do your best for environment and that s what appeals to my wife and me too but we could not quite understand why the duvet cover had holes in it and gowns were 50 polyester with belts not matching On the final note the water temperature in shower was very difficult to regulate it was piping hot and cold and you could not predict how it would change next minute so there was a chance of burn PS This feedback was sent to the hotel management with no response received from them .  Spacious room large bed large window.  No gluten free gravy one of our party was told the gravy was suitable Having sampled it the waiter came to say it contained gluten Some confusion with another meal but were compensated with a free bottle of nice wine .  The staff were wonderful couldn t be more helpful always a smile The rooms were spacious beds super comfy quiet with lots of extras Having a coffee machine proper fresh milk beer and water in fridge fab shower I was with a party of 10 including my 86 year old mother The staff were particularly nice with her and made her feel welcome .  Beds were uncomfortable balcony was very basic and never got the sun.  Good location as a base for Sonar festival Rooftop pool and sunbathing area had great views perfect for our needs Clean and friendly. No Negative.  Location.  Rooms are a bit outdated Carpet was old and should be replaced soon .  Staff was super friendly and helpful Bathroom was a good size Bed was comfortable Location was perfect Literally the first street after leaving the Central train station Within walking to distance to everything .

Food was great in the restaurant Accommodation was great we had a family room . No Negative.  The staff as always are so attentive and professional They are like an away from home family So lovely No request seemed too impossible The room was always so beautifully turned out enjoyed our treats at bedtime and breakfast is amazing This is the reason I always come back Thank you guys.  Rooms are very small Bed is not comfortable.  Good central location.  An extra key per room would be great .  The location is in a quiet neighborhood great for wanting to sleep in It s a few minutes walk from Hyde Park Also close to a metro station and a bus stop The hotel is very quaint and designed beautifully . No Negative.  A very comfortable overnight stay en route to Eurostar journey .  We were charged a whole day parking fee 20 euro although we just stayed for about 20min It s unreasonable previous opinion Follow up The front desk manager of Olivia sent me an appologising email told me they made a mistake and refunded my parking charge They re highly appreciated for their professionalism .  It s really a surpprise in our trip The services of Olivia are wonderful no matter the staffs or the facillties The front desk staff even welcomed us at the parking basement and guided us to hotel The air condition the beding and the light system are terrific and humanization My husband who is critical of the sleeping environment is very satisfied with Olivia .  We stayed in an apartment which only had internal access to the main hotel via a staff service corridor not what I expected The living area was nice if a little dark The bathroom was tiny and cold The bedroom stank of cigarette smoke because HOTEL STAFF WERE SMOKING directly underneath our window all night the window didn t seal properly So disgusted we left after one night .  Good location.  Parking was somewhat limited and you were unable to book a space which is slightly inconvenient however Staff were very friendly and did everything they could to find you a parking space Would be great if the hotel would let you book parking even if it was at a premium rate to provide piece of mind when travelling particularly late We arrived at midnight and would like to have known that we definitely had a car spot rather then just having to wait and see .  The Hotel is very new modern and comfortable Reception was open 24 hours which makes it ideal if travelling inter city to London in the evening after work Parking was 10 per night which is comparable if not cheaper then other hotels in the area We selected this hotel primarily because of its proximity to the London Underground Park Royal station is a 3 min walk making it very easy to get into central London Room was modern and lighting and temperature could be controlled entirely by an access panel on each bedside table Facilities were very clean and the bed was very comfortable .  No bar and general lack of facilities .  Clean with friendly staff.  The duplex room is not good So they changed my room.  Abundance of pillows and large bed Multiple channels on tv.  in the hotel there are rooms without any window i never stayed at a place where for such high price not to say anywhere that offers rooms without indows it means no window one does not know if the sun is shinning or is it already dark out side unbelivable.

Liked the free cellphone unit in the room allowing us to tour the city with free internet and apps like googel maps etc.  The A C didn t work and the shower head didn t work It was too hot on the room and we got four free drinks as an excuse because they could not give as another room When we tried to use the drink cards we got the bartender said the cards is not allowed . No Positive.  It would have been nice to have a little outdoor space Rooftop terrace or courtyard But loved it and will definitely return .  The breakfast was fantastic beautifully cooked pastries plenty of choice The room was spacious with everything you could need The bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in and despite being on the Main Street it was so quiet and cool Also the staff were alwSys on hand to help out i would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Barcelona .  Poor insonorisation Bad service at the breakfast Old bathroom.  Location.

Location close to the shopping street entrance to the hotel is inside the block quite entrance to the metro is located in the same block app 20 meters from the hotel entrance 20 min walking distance to the center of Vienna Good design of the room small kitchen fridge working table spacious room windows look inside the block very quite Staff at reception is helpful.

Room was dated and it s very loud with the windows facing on the Ring No safe in the room .  Location convenient Good breakfast Friendly staff Tea making facilities in the room .  Could ve had more tv channels as only one worked.  Lovely experience nice view and facilities are amazing.  Bed is not the most comfortable the wifi is horrible very slow with having to fill in email address name and room number each time Although breakfast had a good variety it is better to get in earlier as some stuff will not be refilled after 9 so if you want the good stuff don t sleep in No fridge in the room and it is pretty small with two large bags it is a struggle getting ready in the morning Bathroom is also small with no toilet roll holder This hotel should probably be rated as a 2 star hotel .  The location is great close to the underground on the Piccadilly line so easy to get to We were able to check in early that is always great Breakfast offered a good variety of food.  Nothing everything superb if this place had a pool would be a dream hotel.  Wow factor all the personal touches make a special difference e g Ice machine chilled water even empty bottles to fill to use A washing machine and tumble dryer a fresh bean coffee machine all complimentary Bed is comfy and very clean .

The payment system Although the money was never taken twice I had a full payment and a pending transaction in one go I wasn t best pleased about this Arranged for a late checkout for 1pm only to be rung at 11 05 am asking why we hadn t checked out The soundproofing within the hotel could be better as I could hear guests all day that wasn t a problem and had some noisy neighbours in the night this was although not the fault of the hotel people were loud The noise from work being done above us all day was a little annoying as we had not been informed about this .  The location of the hotel was perfect extremely close to the tube station and on a good line to get in and out of the centre Even though the hotel was close to the tube line I heard no noise from it at all The hotel was lovely and clean and the staff were very pleasant The breakfast was good The robes were a lovely touch .

Non existent soundproofing surly staff with the exception of Wen five star service no one answering the internal phone be that reception or room service etc etc.  The hotel was clean and in a good location bed was fab.

Bed comfy hotel room exceptionally clean and really modern .  Although we booked for 2 adults and 2 children 1 baby and requested baby cot the staff were not aware that we did book a family room and did not supply with a cot until later on Unfortunately even then the cot did not have a mattress and the sheets were left inside for us to make it For this reason our baby had to sleep with us in bed which originated not much sleep for mummy as we were afraid she will fall off the bed Disappointing .

No Positive.  The room was too hot Difficult to sleep air con was ineffective Noisy street from 6am.  Staff efficiency Cleanliness.  during the day it looked like a hipster coffee shop Non guests are welcome to come and bring their laptops to the hotel lobby .  Liked the atmosphere at night as the place turned into a hotspot having a club and a lounge bar .  Overall staff were lovely friendly and polite A couple were awkward when trying to organise taxis and room service saying it couldn t be done and you would have to pay them a charge which put a negative slant on an otherwise perfect stay .  Location is excellent Rooms and overall hotel decor is beautiful Spa is lovely would be great if you could block off spa privately like other hotels in Paris as it is so small .  Not having a view was disappointing We were given no directions to our room and it was very difficult to find The cleaner kept opening the very top windows using a ladder and we had huge difficulty closing them It was very cold during our stay when we approached someone about heating he was not very helpful The directions given online re how to find it from Centraal were difficult to follow and a much longer walk than suggested especially in the rain .

Comfortable Bed Good location Nearby metro close to city centre Staffs were supportive .  The staff was unpleasant I got the worst room in the hotel on the first floor at the end of the hall right next to the service room Also the room had a view on huge works it looked like i was sleeping in the works being done The condition and the cleanliness of the room were very poor I asked at the reception to change rooms I was moved to a slighltly better room But again the room looked very old and not clean The room was very noisy at night because of the overground There was even a smell of cigarettes although it was a non smoking room Also the heater in my room was not working The Air conditionning was put at 25 degrees As i was cold at night i called reception and they sent me a heater Of course the heater was in very poor condition and no one noticed that the plug was completly burned I had to call reception again to get another heater The maintenance of the hotel is very bad the conditions of the rooms as well It is a shame that this hotel is rated as a 4 star hotel It should have at mosttt 3 stars I hope i will never have to sleep in this hotel again .

Very pleasant helpful staff Nice and very comfortable room in the end and the location was excellent Would definitely return .  Unhealthy room service options eat fish vegetarian was not told Xmas parties in whilst booking so could not dine from restaurant or order room service off the menu no one seemed to know if restaurant open to guests asked 5 different people Asked for new key as mine faulty was not asked for name etc just my room number .

It quoted on their website as being soundproof but exceptionally noisy like you had your windows open all the time Also the bathroom had no privacy curtain The shower was exceptionally slippery so had to ask for a rubber mat to stop myself sliding all over the place and hurting myself Terrible .  The close proximity to eve thing where it was at your doorstep.  The first night of my stay I was in a superior room directly about the Subway restaurant Therefore the room smelled a lot of greese I tried to ventilate the room and left the balcony door open but unfortunately it did not help the smell at all I told the staff and they apologized but were not able to move me as they were totally booked out As promised they moved me to another room for the second night of my stay .  Hotel is very conveniently located The staff is very nice and reactive Also the breakfast is fabulous .  Nothing.  Everything The hotel is great the staff is amazingly friendly and helpful the rooms are clean and spacious the bed is very comfortable the location is good close to many places but about a 25 minute walk to city center the building is very secure will definitely recommend it to others .  Although the hotel has 4 stars I liked it much less than the 3star Milan hotel I stayed in Although I was convinced we booked a double room we got a twin bed room with two separate beds Although the facility in general was in fine state there was a small rip in our room curtain that I reported since I didn t want to get charged for it Personnel apologized so it was fine but it does set the overall property as used There is no closeby subway stop which was the mode of transport we generally used next to walking so the long walk 10 15mins to the hotel from central it got a bit annoying at the end of long sightseeing days Do have to say that there is a parking garage of the hotel so presumably it is good if you are travelling by car as parking in the centre seemed quite an issue In general the professional but impersonal approach put me off a bit Since the wifi is really slow I wanted to use the only pc in the internet room It didn t seem connected to internet so I asked at the front desk and the man literally replied what can I do rather than solving the problem Luckily his colleague was more helpful the next day and explained me that this pc also needs to connect to wifi rather than network cable so it was sorted fast Also during breakfast I felt sorry for the people that worked there because they felt understaffed or under organised to deal with it in a huge rush slamming new plates and cutlery on the table after guests left to make place for new running around to refresh food platters etc The people were polite but seemed under pressure Also I missed tea coffee facilities in our room leaving you to use vending machines in the corridor which I didn t use .  I think the price quality ratio was good it was good value for money Of course IH is a chain which sets a standard for the services and facilities Therefore I would choose this for business trips or trips with larger groups as the facilities are suited that The room was clean had a large window and fine mattresses on the beds Also the bathroom was quite large and the shower worked fine The breakfast is industrial but fine there are standard bread slices baked off croissants alhtough only a few plain ones the rest was with chocolat and jam 2 or 3 cheeses scrambled egg saucages salads and some sweet cakes .  lONG LONG WALK UP THE RAMP TO THE ROOM WITH LUGGAGE HOLES IN WINDOW GLASS IT WAS COLD I COULD HEAR PERSON NEXT DOOR WHO WAS COUGHING ALL NIGHT.  BED MATRESS.  Towels looked old Musty smell from carpet.  The bed was a great size location good and on site car parking a bonus.  It was perfect.  The view of the room. No Negative.  Very attentive and friendly staff Excellent selection of fresh fruit and berries at the breakfast Calm hotel despite a rather central location . No Negative.  Excellent location Helpful staff .  Room a bit noisy The door and walls are thin and you can really hear people talking on the hall way Sometimes we can even hear kids crying through walls .  Very central location close to metro and transportation hub Lots of good shopping and restaurants nearby Hotel decor is modern and really clean Free coffee and water in the room are great bonus . No Negative.  Staff were helpful. No Negative.  Convenient for Wembley Arena Speedy check in Pleasant helpful staff Excellent breakfast .  check out very slow paid for an superior king room the only difference was a king size bed and dressing gowns room comfortable but nothing special and quite tired would stay again but wouldn t upgrade it wasn t worth the extra cost .  Helpful staff great location and good breakfast Handy having a 24 hours Waitrose under the hotel .  Nothing.  Every thing .  A pit noisy at night with window open but earplugs provided .  Comfy beds clean and modern . No Negative.  Great location with very friendly staff was clean and very welcoming.  Parking was tight.  Great location and friendly staff .  Wifi almost impossible to get hotel not bad but too far from other interesting places took too long to reach Central London.  Staff breakfast.  Room could do with some cheering up decor was a bit plain .  Great quiet location and friendly staff .  worst beds in over 7 hotels slept in on this trip poor design of room location we had to use the service lift.  One front desk girl was very helpful.  The room was very compact. No Positive.  Would have liked there to be subtitles for the movies as well as for the TV as I am deaf and it meant that we couldn t watch a movie However the fire alarm went off in the night and it woke me up as it had a red flashing light so that was a good thing .  The room was very comfortable and clean minimalist in size but I expected that from the info given on the website I felt the space was well used The room was great fun I enjoyed changing the colours of the lights in the bathroom Wonderful lounge and breakfast tea and coffee Also I asked staff to put a note saying Happy Birthday Peter in our room as a surprise for my husband they put up lots of greetings and pictures and left a little pastry with a candle it was a lovely generous touch thank you I would love to stay again . No Negative.  We loved the bathroom Great value fot that price . No Negative.  Great facilities lovely staff and rooms good food .  It took a long time to get served drinks in the cocktail bar there were plenty of staff but they weren t as efficient as they could have been.  The room and view were great.  small room the location from the nearest station is a bit far.  we liked the breakfast. No Negative.  We had such a lovely stay The decor is really cool the rooms are spacious comfortable clean The staff were friendly helpful Breakfast was amazing so much choice good food Location is handy just a short stroll from La Rambla .  furnishing should be partially renovated.  staff availability.  Literally at the border of Milan so getting there might be a problem on Sundays Otherwise the connectivity is good .  Comfort Breakfast.  Hotel Bar closed at 23 00 hours some nights .  Location Breakfast was amazing Warmth as it was cold outside and Staff Helpfulness.  Room amneties were lacking didnt refil tissues.  Good service reception was extremely helpful to recommend places to eat Room was clean.  Mixup with the reservation. No Positive.  breakfast cool food bacon hard did not get fruit cocktail in bar also could not take our prepaid breakfast one day total 31 50 but hotel would not give a refund did not like handing car keys in and long walk to tube.  most of it staff excellent room clean good air con food in bar good not to pricey for London good reception staff and doorman nice bed fridge usefull.  In the bathroom the loo roll holder is on the wrong way round and the roll fell off EVERY time you wanted to take some paper Also the washing things fell out of the rack in the shower all the time and I put my soap in there which immediately fell out on to my toe Nasty bruise Shower itself very good Did not enjoy indifferent dinner taken in sister hotel l Am e.  We liked the helpful staff very much We liked being able to help ourselves to coffee tea in the lounge downstairs We don t eat breakfast so cannot comment on that as it was taken in the sister hotel over the road We loved the position very handy for all outings and sights We had a balcony with no view but it was nice being able to have it open at night .  Our bathroom door was stuck but the staff managed it pretty fast .  We had a very pleasant stay The bed was really big and the room over all was to our liking The hotel is located in the west part of the city and the piccadilly line of the tube was just on the other side of the road Park Royal Station 35 40 mins to piccadilly circus Moreover there is another Tube station about ten minutes away the central line hangers lane the breakfast was also great We would recommend the hotel to everyone who likes to be a little outside of the fuzz in the city .  Overall a bit too dark Airco was not working sticky in the room 6 for a very small glas of vine is too much.  Nice garden terrace very close to the next Metro station.  The room wasn t really a room more like a cupboard The door couldn t open properly because the furniture a bed a chair and a desk that had been crammed into the cupboard in a desperate attempt to make it pass as a room took up the entire floor space There was no space for me to put down my bag other than on the chair and that left nowhere for me to sit or stand other than on the bed I felt quite literally like I was a child hiding in a store room meanwhile the hotel staff told me there was no way to change rooms Having already paid for my two night stay I felt compelled to make the most out of it but I should have just left I slept reasonably well but slipped into depression the claustrophobia anxiety that I didn t have adequate accommodation when I was supposed to be enjoying myself in town and lack of self worth to be accepting a cupboard as my dwelling added up to an oppressive wall of negative feelings surely only ordinarily experienced by the homeless I bit the bullet and paid for a second hotel after the first night I simply left and never went back My advice to others is to pay a few extra pounds at a hotel where you actually get a room instead of being crammed into a storage space like a pile of unwanted linen .  Nothing the negatives outweighed any positives and I m left feeling scarred by the experience of visiting the hotel. No Negative.  Very comfortable bed Very modern facilities shower Quiet room . No Negative.  Location receiption internet room service 10 gbp malbec wine room condition.  Very very dated rooms scuffed paintwork really bad bathrooms .  Great location friendly staff Nice lobby .  Too expensive in my view .  Location.  The lifts had disarranged buttons A strange thing for a 5 star hotel They seemed vandalized .  Location. No Negative.  I stay often when on business in Amsterdam I have tried many hotels in the area over the years This one is my favourite Great staff comfortable beds and good value for money . No Negative.  Its hard to say what we liked about the hotel most as we liked absolutely everything When we arrived we were pleasantly surprised to get an upgrade from standard room to junior suite The staff at the reception were extremely polite and fast both with check in and check out the room was cosy well equipped and quiet We also enjoyed the variety of food during the breakfast We would definitely choose this hotel for our stay again . No Negative.  I ve rarely met such a smiling and attentive staff The room was beautiful decorated with great taste and with modern facilities With a bath it would have been just perfect Ideal location in central London Definitely recommended.  For my purposes this time this was ideal .  Relaxed efficient staff check in and check out very simple and quick Room and en suite finished to very high standard for price bracket Would definitely recommend .  There is little storage space in the rooms that stayed in Price of laundry whilst it may be inline with the market is EXTORTIONATE .  Very friendly staff nice bar recently refurbished hotel .  Bedroom size.  Great food great dining room staff.  N a.  Staff cleanliness location private pool in the suite Probably one of the best places you can ever stay in when in London for the price We stayed in the Splash Suite and it was a unique experience .  Can t think of anything .  The coffee was excellent The shower was amazing It s a quiet neighbourhood so we got a good night sleep. No Negative.  Location was great and the breakfast was also very good .  Pretty grim looking shower cubicle and shower head in room 517 worked ok but not a pleasant experience Needs replacing Breakfast room needs a manager to direct staff and ensure that there is enough food available Would also benefit from reorganising the layout of items available as it is not logical people were going backwards and forwards in a very small place to get what they wanted Quite dangerous too Food was good quality but we were disappointed by several empty containers and apparently no attempt to replenish just looked bad A wait to be seated sign might help as several people bypassed the log in desk as there was no one there It didn t feel like a 16 per head experience .  Excellent location for Royal Albert Hall and Hyde Park Comfortable bed.  Smelly room Very bad noise insulation too .  Good location .  Not returned to the pledge card 50 EUR although promised in 5 days.  The bed extra comfy The room warm and cozy .  Tiny rooms noise from street could be heard easily with windows closed thus awake all night and awful nights sleep Date tiny bathroom .  Bar and bar staff were great.  I have been staying at the Courthouse during the last 10 years several times Unfortunately this hotel is deteriorating in terms of its rooms spa bar and overall outfit It will definitely require an upgrade to keep up with others in the area .  Central location.  Staff not listening to what you order The wife booked a hair appointment and this was fully confirmed by the hotel manager but when she went for the appointment nobody was there She called reception who did nothing Waited 30 mins and went to reception to be advised that the hair dresser had an accident and could not make it The hotel is also very dark and not really up to four star standard yet alone the claimed five star Also the hotel and it s story is all fabricated by its owner Built in a lie I guess which sets the tone Dissapointed and would not return.  Bathroom was very clean.  Nil.  Great location clean room breakfast buffet with adequate choices of food .  very dark room The carpet in the second floor is very old and requiers to be renovated It get you a bad impression about the hotel .  The location is excellent The staff was very kind . No Negative.  We stayed here because we were going to the O2 It was an excellent location The Emirates cable cars are across the road which take you to the O2 Close to Stratford which was great for shopping Breakfast was very good Staff were very friendly and helpful Room was a fair size A great stay Would definitely recommend and will stay again .  Deceiving as expecting a 5 property No water in room on day 2 hence no shower Had to cross the street to sister Hotel and shower in a recently vacated dirty room in a dirty bathroom No restaurant offering only sandwiches in the evening No one asked me how my stay went upon check out Walls and doors are not noiseproof and I heard the neighbours having fun on multiple occasions Very average stay Will probably not stay there again .  Location.  The lift was broken that enable you to go to the leisure club So the alternative was to go out of the hotel down 2 flights of stairs through the underground car park It was absolutely freezing Also I had to carry my daughter down two flights of stairs An absolute nightmare The main reason we chose this hotel was for its leisure facilities I understand that this was an issue that was out of the hotels control However the manager on duty at the time was totally unsympathetic and kept saying it was out of their control I knew it was out of their control Also the beds were too soft so we had backache .  Rooms were clean and tidy.  No mini bar.  Great artwork very stylish.  No complimentary for toothpaste and toothbrush no shampoo Room is too small for two The furniture is too small as like table and armchair .  Friendly staff and good location.  No refrigerator in the room.  Good location and good price.  I could not find my room 462 . No Positive.  We enjoyed the stay but it was nothing stand out The decor is very simple with plain colours and a minimalist feel Also it felt quite formal and not quite our type of place with all the staff being extremely polite and other guests lounging by the pool taking selfies of themselves Obviously not a fault of the hotel but we probably wouldn t stay again in preference of a more lively casual place .  Overall the hotel was nice clean very friendly staff tasty breakfast We had a dip in the rooftop pool enjoyed the comfy bed and made the most of the blackout blinds Very good electronics provided and everything felt of good quality .  As above .  Single room at back of hotel With window but looked into air con units .  BBQ Chicken Panini was not enjoyable would actually question if it was infact chicken . No Positive.  RAT IN THE ROOM seriously Rat I didn t like rat eating my belongings and rat poison under my bed.  Nothing good about this hotel.  Noise both from inside and outside the hotel.  Location breakfast.  Needs to improve hygiene Took over half an hour to find my booking Bar downstairs looks like a bordello . No Positive. No Negative.  Not a 4 start hotel but nice for a quick stay in Milan Comfortable and clean Localisation was practical for reaching the airport or when we come by car .  Pillows too hard And only wine or beer for sale I would have preferred a gin or vodka.  Bed very comfy Clean very tidy Friendly helpful staff Location excellent. No Negative.  The staff were so friendly really great hotel Conviniently close to central tram lines . No Negative.  Staff very agreeable Near transport Near shopping Great restaurant on premises .  Air Conditioning System didn t work properly .  WONDERFUL BREAKFAST VERY FRIENDLY STAFF . No Negative.  Clean well equipped friendly And I left a precious necklace in a room and they were very helpful in getting it back to me . No Negative.  Very modern practical set up everthong run through an in room ipad. No Negative.  Room was lovely decorated Brekfast had good selections . No Negative.  Excellent value for money Great little hotel Clean tidy modern and very easy to find Staff were so helpful that there was nothing they couldn t provide They re a credit to both aloft and W hotels Would definitely stay here again .  Couldn t access the Jacuzzi as it was mostly full of kid and their parents Too far from the tube .  Food was very good Gym and spa Service .  The light switches in the room take some time to identify which light goes with which switch .  Charming and spacious hotel .  The hotel is overpriced and I don t think the rooms are worth the money we paid they are very basic The breakfast was disappointing they didn t have a very nice selection The hot breakfast boiled eggs scrambled eggs and bacon wasn t fully cooked and the pastries were stale .  The room was clean and very quiet The location was good It was was a short walking distance from the central train station and city centre And has good tram and metro links to the city centre . No Negative.  Very nice attention given by the receptionist I was offered a very warm welcome together with a welcome drink at my choice before checking in to the room The standard room has a great setup for its size My room despite was right in front of the lift but that never bothered me neither the street noise has ever came to my attention The whole level of comfort was great in general I tried the breakfast once it could still be better but for a four star hotel and the booking com deal I got it was just fine I couldn t use the rooftop pool this time and I will make sure to come back once again when the weather is warmer The hotel area is full of nice restaurants and access to the city .  Rooms were extremely tiny definitely too small for two people sharing and for more than a single night stay Rooms were not cleaned well thick layer of dust remained everywhere for all 4 days of our stay and there were stains on the bed covers as well as the curtains Cleaners actually used some of our body lotion which was kept away inside the cupboard while we were out for the day .  Location was convenient to public transport.  Larger bar area to relax in at night.  Afternoon tea and cake Breakfast excellent Staff friendly and helpful.  no security any one can reach the room easily you dont need a card to access the elevator no security guard in the entrance visitors are mainly khaliji boys rooms are small and no extra bed can fit in the room.  location and friendly stuff. No Negative.  Comfy bed quite location clean neat room.  States fee wifi but had to pay for it.  Staff were really helpful.  The air in the room is not so good .  Extremely good service . No Negative.  outstanding breakfast.  Nothing that I could remember but the beds were somewhat soft for my taste I did not have breakfast in the hotel therefore could not rate it or comment on it .  We had two rooms the stay was enjoyable and the location of the hotel was perfect The staff were very nice the people in the front line that faced the guests to the people that worked in the background I had the pleasure to interact with them and they all were nice .  Nothing it was great.  Great location friendly staff All staff spoke English which was a huge bonus A really comfy bed Great options of up to 16 products of bath gels moisturisers hair shampoos conditioners A roof top bar .  The service in the Skybar was extremely slow views excellent pool not heated.  The hotel driver that took us back to the airport was extremely friendly Rooms lovely very clean modern Fantastic location We would stay again.  No hot water and WiFi for part of the stay .  Convenient location .  Bathroom floor flooded after shower Air conditioning didn t work The slowest lift in England .  Good location .  Sadly the concert was cancelled and travel insurance would not reimburse for the cancelled concert Unfortunately the food was getting poor reviews from others staying so we ate at a restaurant outside .  Location to venue for concert The bar and staff were extremely good .  No security as anyone could walk up to room Furniture etc old and falling apart . No Positive.  Rooms could have been a higher standard for money paid Requested upstairs room but got given basement Took 2 different people to find our booking and this happend at both arrival and check in as we arrived early unable to check n straight away .  Bed room was ok Bar and resturant was lovely. No Negative.  We had a room with a patio and it was very comfortable and spacious with access to the pool from the patio Bathroom is big with nice shower .  The person coming to clean the room in the morning knocked a few times and we had the room till 12 Would have been nice to wait for us to have booked out.  The bed as comfy and the person who brought the bags up as very polite.  Bed Uncomfy Cannot open windows in room Check in and check out times inconvenient .  Modern hotel amazing rooftop bar .  It could have been more clean first when we arrived it smelled really bad Also I couldn t sleep well because people on the hallways and other rooms upstairs were too loud .  The location was fantastic Also the view was really nice .  traffic noise.  staff helpfulness.  Breakfast wasn t great.  Right next to main Tourist Bus stop and easy 10 minute walk to centre Friendly helpful staff.  Room is just too small.  Great location the staff was nice.  It was our third stay in this hotel In the past we was very satisfied and recommended on it Unfortunately this time we were disappointed very much We got a small room without closet It was very uncomfortable .  The Design is wonderful and original .  Room was very small Staff not very helpful The bar closed at 11 30pm with no notification .  Great location and really easy to get to the tube .  No minibar in rooms. No Positive.  Location.  Nice atmosphere friendly staff .  The mattress could be a bit more comfy There was was no concierge and a small reception for a hotel of that size .  Nice hotel close to the beach and the tube station Great shower the roof top swimming pool has a sea view Delicious breakfast .  Nothing really we really enjoyed our stay I noticed after we arrived that if we had booked direct with the hotel rather than through booking com we would have saved 30 on the hotel breakfast There s not a huge amount of early breakfast options nearby so this would be a good idea for a future stay .  Lovely modern hotel with decent sized pool and great rooftop bar Very comfortable rooms extremely clean and well serviced The hotel is in a good location a little away from the hustle of las ramblas only a 10 15 minute walk from the nearest metro stations Great shopping nearby although it s not cheap .

The room was beautiful I m not sure about value for money as we were upgraded .  there was music late at night in the street on the night I was there but apparently it doesn t happen usually.  Large room large for 1 or 2 people but a bit small though for 4 with a very confortable bed well isolated from neighbours I didn t my brother s baby crying in the room next door nice terrace on top floor family friendly .  Poor quality furnishings in disrepair basic rooms and facilities extortionate bar prices even for a hotel and cold buffet breakfast not often refreshed .  Excellent views helpful staff and brilliant location for local bars .  The check in was slow The bar area is outdated and not welcoming.  The rooms are great value The roof terrace is a treat.

Excellent welcome and stay apart from nearly being frauded by somebody on booking com site luckily Savoy helped in every way Excellent. No Negative.  The rooms are furnished very nicely Great bathrooms If you want to see a lot of London it is a great location .  The beds are very high which is an issue for reduced mobility there is a step but little purchase for the hands Very warm I opened a window and I like warm places .  This hotel is very compact unsurprisingly as it is about 100yards from the shard .  Bed could have been bigger but apart from that was great value for money .  Great value clean room and excellent location had a peaceful sleep many thanks.  This is not a 4 hotel poor service and bad location away from everything There was noise in the common areas every morning there were undergoing repairs or smth toiletries were not fully replenished daily there was not even a bottle of water in the room or some cutleries a maid slummed our door when there was actually do not disturb sign The worse of all was this broken glass partition in the bathroom when at some point glass particles got spread around the bathroom and we both cut our feet We asked staff to fix that but it was only done by maid next day so we literary could not use the bathroom that night Quite disappointing and overpaid .  The design concept is the only think I liked rest is rather disappointing. No Negative.

Location by Metro View from rooftop pool Rooftop pool beds and pool. No Negative.  Excellent staff friendly and accommodating .  The decor inside but I think that s more about Italian style than the hotel itself it s not unique to there .  The breakfast was great and the staff were very attentive Great location for the metro .

Friendly staff immaculately clean and a great breakfast included in the price so excellent value. No Negative.  Good breakfast vegetarian vegan able to enjoy food.  We were allocated to room for physically challenged persons which i did not expect It should have been mentioned in the booking com description itself Disappointed with that . No Positive.  I thought I was booking a twin room and the email confirmation of my booking from Booking com specified i had asked for two singles However when I tried to check in I discovered that the Kenilworth sees all such bookings from Booking com as Doubles I was given a twin as it happened to be available but that was pure luck and I was told that many people expecting a twin booked through Booking com at this hotel are disappointed Anyone who wants to be certain that they will get a twin room should not book this hotel via Booking com The phone number provided by Booking com in the email confirmation was actually for the Bloomsbury Radisson Blu instead .  The staff were very pleasant and helpful The location is great .  The hotel restaurant very busy You need prior reservation for dinner the hotel guys shoud let us know when check in For the ladies bad make up light in the bathroom .  Great personnel great rooms great location great food.  No Mirror in the bedroom .

No Negative.  Location very good Clean room breakfast price.  a often unstable Wi Fi in the room b the absence of bathscale.  Very very nice hotel fresh new building all things function well of course clean located in a quiet clean area we always prefer this in the waterfront 5 minutes for walking to the Central station any city site is easily reachable by tram from this point and the same for arriving at Prinsengracht Sufficiently large say 28 sqm room BTW all rooms are daylightful a pretty comfortable space supplying bar Guest friendly reception staff they provided to us three rooms one after the other keeping the same price from our booking com reservation 184 euros per night in the July beginning with taking into account our requirements when asked by us a bit unsatisfied by the first two rooms for another room You don t feel that the hotel is not a luxury one Warmly recommend it .  They tried charging another 400 when checking out. No Positive.  It was a bit far away from central Amsterdam but we didn t mind travelling in everyday Also check in was late for us as we arrived at the hotel at 11am but had to wait around for 3 hours until 2pm to get into our room After an early morning flight we were tired and would have liked our room a bit earlier .  Beds comfy staff friendly and ready to help if we needed directions etc Rooms cleaned everyday and good facilities .  Bedrooms and bathrooms extremely small and no baths available throughout the hotel whatever category room you booked .  Comfortable adjustable beds room service tea free of charge parking on site .  Bathroom on small side but was clean Shower unit would have been the better option Air conditioning was on the noisy side but on the whole very enjoyable.  All staff friendly and helpfull Nothing was too much trouble.  The rooms need painting and renovating there were stains on the walls and we also had a spiders web with files behind the curtains The bathroom door on the inside at the bottom was a mess Also in the room is a kitchen that takes up quite a lot of space You can t make a hot drink as there are no cups or a kettle just glasses and a pan but it does have a decent sized fridge When you walk in and out of the hotel you get hit by a blanket of cigarette smoke as this is where all the smokers congregate sitting outside it s terrible .  The hotel staff were very pleasant and helpful The breakfast was ok . No Negative.  The whole service made us feel special thankyou. No Negative.  Quite hotel rooms. No Negative.  Friendly staff Loved the free mini bar in the room At 6pm complimentary wine tea coffee and cookies A lovely touch The bed was so comfie Enjoyed our stay .

Staff we not very friendly.  lovely hotel and excellent location .  Room was tiny barely any space to walk around the bed Air con wasn t working well and can t open a window so very warm.  Shower was nice and powerful. No Negative.  Everything was amazing a lovely stay and amazing rooms However it was difficult understanding some of the staff.  No gym small room.  room with balcony nice location.  The breakfast could have been better not much choice and whilst I enjoyed the Thai version of rice congee the bread was tasteless and there was no choice of milk No major complaint though I was allergic to the washing powder they used so the towels and the bedding brought me out in a rash but that wasn t the fault of the hotel.  The staff were helpful and the location good my single room was comfortable the shower a reasonable size instead of the tiny ones you cannot move in and everything was clean the fridge in the room was a bonus too.  There was construction but it wasn t a disruption .  Wonderful quaint hotel in a great location The staff was very nice and accommodating I stayed in the deluxe double with a bathtub It was perfect very clean well kept and comfortable I especially liked the deep bathtub I highly recommend .  Shower arrangement in the bath and only one wifi device per password .  Beautiful grounds and room we had superior Restaurant was exceptional .  Pillows and bed Room service has no food only limited snacks Elevator s small space .  Location Staff Bathroom space.  Dated rooms although I think some are being modernised ventilation was noisy in bedroom very poor quality selection at bar and slow service .  Location to DLR and underground sense of security and safety on premises bed size and comfort .  Air con didn t work They took so long to try and move me I decided to stay put in the room on the 10th floor and the noise outside with the window open is horrendous All ambulances and police in the world seem to drive past with their sirens on .  Modern and nice accessible hotel with a great breakfast .  I would not recommend to stay in this hotel or have dinner in the restaurant inside the hotel About the restaurant all meals are over priced the food quality is less than average We arrived to the restaurant at around 9 pm the restaurant closes at 9 30 pm and the last order was at 9 20 pm according to the front staff Staff quality at the restaurant was really poor They forgot to ask how to cook steaks didn t ask any sauce to bring the worst experience at restaurant I ve ever gone The sausage was not cooked properly half rare the spring rolls were very tiny too oily and over priced The reception staff did not speak good English or she had basically difficulty to understand what customer wants I simply asked her I need to have early breakfast earlier than their breakfast serving time but didn t give me clear answer and I need to wait to talk to the male leader or a male manager to arrive The manager was not very polite anyway Car park was too small so we needed to park on the road where very dark and I did not feel safe to park my car there I will never go to the restaurant again .  Nothing .  Didn t like the idea of one nights holding fee as had already prepaid for the room have not come across this at other hotels This did take a little bit of sorting out but the manager was very helpful in dealing with this query There is also a 50 holding fee for any use of the mini bar in the room All monies reimbursed the next day very efficient notice of these holding fees on website wouldn t go amiss overall would book again .  Perfect for theatre very comfortable beds reasonably spacious rooms very clean Didn t use restaurant but menu selection looked good and reasonably priced for London.  No tea in room only coffee.  Location and friendly staff.  Everything was wonderful.  Location ambiance food.  It was a bit out of the way Nothing within walking distance although the bus stop was close Not much to choose from on the food menu .  The bed was comfortable and the shower was nice All staff were very helpful with giving information about the area where to eat drink and how to get to where you wanted to go .  Monotonous breakfasts .  The cleanest hotel I ve ever been to Friendly staff that was very helpful Spacious room with a comfortable bed Close to the city centre .  Breakfast was average Tinned fruit doesn t cut it in 2016.  Room was a great size staff were excellent and room was air conditioned .  The noise from the courtyard but apparently an upgrade on the windows building to ensure better sound proofing is imminent The follow up to my complaint on the noise levels from the courtyard was satisfactory.  The fantastic location.  Nothing I didn t like.  The bed amazing and comfy stuff were lovely best hotel i ve stayed in .  Rooms are very small.  Location.  Very small room And special bathroom Maximum for 1 night staying.  Good location.  The fact you have to pay 7 a day for use of wifi.  The room was very clean and the view was great.  The noise from the street was quite irritating especially it was still 6am in the morning.  Good location nice staff breakfast is good also.  Kettle not working properly and lights above beds did not work Everything else was good .  Breakfast is good and the room comfortable .  We had two rooms and one was much nicer than the other different prices though Also billed for items from mini fridge that we didn t have Had to go to reception to get these removed from the bill .

This place is the best I have stayed here twice both times the experience has been superb I stayed in the annex across the street everything was fine There were six pillows on my bed The Berna is a quiet oasis in a busy city .  Safety.  I was robbed in the reception of the hotel Someone stole my bag and the staff was doing nothing.

Very clean and great facilities in the apartment The shower was amazing . No Negative.  This hotel was amazing The staff were very helpful and friendly our room was so spacious The location was perfect really did find everything at the door 100 would stay again and recommend to anyone .

Lacks a bit of atmosphere It s new so maybe the art pictures are yet to arrive The bedroom was a good size clean nice but not cosy .  High standard of public areas and bedroom shower Good gym Nice pool too .  This is an unusual small thing to comment on but the three low hanging halogen lights above the bed drove me crazy I kept turning them on by accident and felt like I was under an oven griller or being seriously interrogated .

Only the location Nothing else.  The location there was allready one open water bottle in the mini bar when i came and the lobby staff respond was okay do you want me to change it for you it is okay becouse it is free we wont charge you for it .  The only thing I can think about this hotel that is good is that the mini bar is free but there is only soda water.  Lift broke down so there was only 1 functioning lift consequently long waits .

Staff were good but not great could have been more helpful at check in with a couple of our reasonable requests Didn t seem to want to help too much but were friendly and efficienct .

Bathroom was very small so could have had more wall hooks for hanging clothes wash bags etc instead of having to place them on the floor The shower was only hand held with no head height socket so showering was rather awkward A rather strange hand held bottom washer shower hose right next to the toilet .  Room 114 was big enough and very clean Bed very comfortable Outlook from window was acceptable though at times there was a strong smell of cooking .  Elevators too small Need to wait for 15 minutes if large crowed in front of you Room is too small Bed is too small compared to four or three star hotels in the US Internet keep interrupted Towels provided are not enough No iron and board available in the room .

Breakfast was quite poor for the price we paid and the woman at the breakfast room reception was a bit harsh to people sitting down at random tables each room had a reserved table Also the maids kept coming over our table to take away the empty dishes as soon as we d put down our fork spoon It felt really unpleasant to be constantly interrupted during the whole breakfast .

Bathroom did not have heating Beds pillows could be more comfortable for a 4 star hotel .

We weren t told there was additional cost to the room when we booked it It was tax on the room per night this should ve been made aware prior to the online booking to allow us to budget for the extra cost .  The room was perfect great bathroom too lovely and clean Fantastic view from our room and not too far from the centre walkable only took us 40 mins to walk Right next to tram service to the city centre too tram only took 25 mins or so Great shuttle bus to and from airport Friendly staff who were really helpful .

Very friendly staff booked a small double it was spotlessly clean and perfectly adequate for a short break Would recommend the restaurant abuzzo not far from the hotel for great food and great atmosphere .  The room had a big nasty stain on the carpet near the bed It was horrible becuase it reminder you that others had been in the room .

No Positive.  This hotel is 3 stars maximum and expected much more form a 5 starts hotel Rooms are very very small unless you want a basement room with a small window and extra humidity Very poor lighting in the bathrooms and good luck if one wants to shave or put makeups Most photos you see on the web such as google are from the Montcalm hotel across the street Watch for the mice .  Location is excellent and beds pillows are very comfortable Good Free Wifi and a handy small pad for internet and free calls Complimentary fruits and water and tea coffee facilities Staff very nice and helpful .  1 The room location was much to be desired 440 is located at the far end of the hotel 2 I asked for a queen size bed but was given two single beds put together the bed was comfortable until you fall through the middle which I did and sprained my ankle in the process Especially annoying due the the fact I called the lobby when I entered my room just to express my concern yet they said they think I will enjoy it 3 The shower was very small hardly enough space to turn without hitting your elbow on the glass door or wall 4 Elevator broke but wasn t confirmed fixed before letting the public us it I got stuck on the 4th floor which is weird cause another guy got off at the 2nd floor The elevator was out of service for a couple of days but when it was supposed to be fixed I got trapped inside Luckily it still moved when I pressed the 5th floor button and got out walked the stairway down after that .  1 The location was great just across the street from Milan central station Easy access to the metro and railway 2 Room deco was unique and the mood light in the bathroom was a nice touch 3 Free arcade games in the lobby 4 The coffee machine was great with 4 capsules to chose from .

Very attentive and pleasant staff Delicious breakfast a big plus no background music . No Negative.  The fresh fruit and real flowers in the room on our arrival was really wellcoming Very good breakfast and once again real flowers on table at breakfast really nice Staff all very helpful and friendly .  The staff at breakfast had very little command of the English language and did not understand our order After a few attempts at trying to explain our requests they eventually got the gist although it still was not quite correct but we gave up at this point .  We have stayed at this hotel a few times over the years and it was nice to return to a familiar and friendly hotel in a great location.  Nothing.  Everything.  The single beds move if you try to sit up in bed with back to the wall The double bed was actually two single beds put next to each other The staff was either not well trained or not aware of the level of customer service the hotel management wants to offer Here are couple of examples I asked for extra tea bags and creamers at 8 am in the morning there were only two Black tea bags and creamers for three of us staying in the family room The receptionist told us the housekeeping will come at 9 am and supply will be replenished then Upon emphasising the need this person consulted another staff and agreed to send the supplies immediately I enquired about booking a cab to airport The person at the reception told me there was no need to book a cab He said cabs are available round the corner and can be got in no time Not satisfied I again inquired later to another person at the reception He pulled out a booking sheet and put down time cab was required and room no He said he will book the cab I wonder why different responses from different staff .  The pluses were good location cleanliness good breakfast with large variety and all amenities and supplies that you expect in a good hotel The bathroom was very good with hand shower rain shower bath tub and bath curtain We had a comfortable stay .  walk to nearest bus station or tube station about 5 mins or more.  breakfast was very good bed was comfortable view was amazing.  The bathroom shower glass was see through into the bedroom so no privacy to use the toilet etc.  Lovely helpful staff and modern Functional room.  This is a lovely hotel but I did have a few issues during the stay Nothing major but something for the hotel to think about 1 The aircon is poor it was extremely hot on the first day of my stay but I just couldn t get the room to cool down and had to have a cold shower 2 On the second night I was kept awake until 4am due to loud music outside either from the bar or club downstairs 3 The wifi code was not easily accessible I had a busy schedule so didn t manage to ask reception for it until near the end of my stay I think it should be provided in the hotel room or given at check in without the guest having to ask for it .  Lovely clean hotel good size rooms and delicious breakfast .  none.  The atmosphere at this hotel is lovely it is truly charming with wonderful staff lovely rooms and staff that really help especially the concierges It works for business due to location but equally well for a romantic break .  More milk and tea bags lol.  Large nice comfy rooms nice shower suitable for 2 people . No Negative.  Friendly helpful staff very good value breakfast had a good choice of menu we were served with great patience all four of us were of older age Would recommend to any traveller thank you for your good service .  Mould in the windowsill in the bathroom rather small room .  Friendly staff close to Underground clean room .  Showerhead fixture not stable regrettably as so often in hotels .  Less than a minute walking to Champs Elysees Nice modern interior design throughout the hotel from reception to breakfast hall in basement to room fairly spacious for Paris city centre to bathroom .  Forniture in poor conditions.  Staff and wonderful breakfast lounge.  main road at the front of the hotel could be noisy early morning did nt realise we could have used the window shutters to block out the sound .  scrambled eggs on rye bread fresh fruit salad and good coffee made a perfect breakfast .  Too far from main tourist attractions A daily start of 15 20 mins walk each day becomes tiring .  Comfortable bed Very quiet at night for a good sleep. No Negative.  The breakfasts and decor .  We were booked into a room with 2 double beds The room was small so our suitcases had to go on one of the beds The bed we slept on was very small for 2 people plus it was very hot Breakfast wasn t available until 8am and as we needed to leave by 8 to catch a bus we didn t have breakfast Also check in isn t until 3pm Very expensive .  Handy location . No Negative.  The staff were very helpful and friendly .  As a guest at the hotel you shouldn t have to pay for parking Also the staff who didn t speak very good english spoke too quickly Also i paid a 50 deposit which i still haven t had credited to my account They took the full payment including the parking and the deposit when we checked in On checking my account when we left they took payment of the car park and hotel but the 50 had not been credited .  The room was tidy and clean lovely view of the river.  Nothing.  The staff couldn t do enough for us They was excellent.  First of all the entire floor i was in smelled like weed the entire time of the stay i dont know if someone was smoking and if that is an ok thing there Sencond they supposedly are a pet friendly hotel and i took my dog with me there he usually does his business outside but unfortunately during our stay he wasnt feeling well and the first day he peed in the bathrom which i cleaned and also called a cleaning lady to disinfect the small are in the bathroom floor and tiped her 10 Two days later i drank an orange juice from their minibar and i started to get nausea and chills so i went to the hispital for 2 hours therefore i couldn t take the dog with me so i left him in the room with toys and food and water The dog had pooped in the bathroom on a towel for which they did not only charged me 150 euros but also took the liberty to take photos of the room which is a tootal violation of privacy not only the room but also the dog and my things Needles to mention they are theifs and dont give change back they value the city tax as they please not as the law has it Basically avoid going there becouse they will for sure find smth to take the warranty money away from you and also dont go if you do not want to be overcharged for weed smelling small cubicles And according to the cleaning staff they change the sheets every 2 days which is really unprofessional They still owe me the change from the first payment of the hotel which the recepsion lady refused to give .  The only thing worth was the location. No Negative.  The staff was very friendly and the room was very clean and enough large . No Negative.  the room was very big and comfortable.  nothing.  friendly staff perfect location.  The menu of breakfast was poor and also house cleaner didn t do a good job .  We have got the upgrade of room and it was almost perfect room to stay .  Building work started at 8am so meant there wasn t much chance of a lie in .  The staff were all very professional and helpful When we arrived they gave us advice on bus tours etc This wasn t a hard sell it was just to be helpful to us When we were struggling with tickets for a show the receptionist offered to print them for us above and beyond I reckon Also because it was a special occasion they delivered a bottle of champagne to our room Unexpected and very much appreciated .  Room was basic and needed an update Curtains would not pull together .  Good choice of basic breakfast food Ok for a 1 night stay .  Noisy work made 1st room terrible even though I d asked for a quiet room 2nd room was a bit better.  staff were great. No Negative.  Breakfast good Pretty efficient were not helpful though when I needed the room a little longer even though they were not full Staff are reasonably helpful not over friendly but OK. No Negative.

My flight was early so we arrived in the morning before the check in time They prepared the room in one hour and I did check into the room 11 am without extra charge that was amazing and I really appreciate Great location .  Location was far from metro station and the man at reception wasn t friendly.  Decoration clean room bathroom.  The hotel was not very clean specially on the hallways and elevators Phone in the room was visibly broken on the earpiece Curtain in the room was stained by what we think was food Made staff aware of this Airconditioning not working properly and room was stuffy We had stayed before and the first time was perfect this time around not so much.  Location of hotel and friendliness of staff .  My bathroom located in the corner of the bulding was very nice 2 entire walls with windows but it lacks a best located mirror to shave .  Comfortable and spacious bedrooms Excellent value for money Only 10 minutes tramway drive from the hotel to the center . No Negative.  Staff were so friendly welcoming and comforting rooms were very modern and spacious Location was great only a 10 minute walk to Westfields shopping centre and the train bus stations .  Wi Fi is charged which is weird in this digital era The hotel has a business center room where you can use a computer and printer but the hotel does not have a standard for its application One day we used the computer there for free the other day the officer there wanted to charge us but we explained our reason it was for an address check in Google Maps so they allowed us free usage This is the first time I see a hotel where the business center is not free for hotel customers .  The location is convenient for both public transportation and shopping The breakfast was super Staff at front desk and restaurant is friendly and professional .  Plastic bag over smoke alarm .  Quiet room.  I had to wait for my room Even though I gave my time of arrival The reception did not apologies and no hospitality offered because of the in conscience When I eventually went to my room I found the window wide open at first I thought it was a good idea I shut the windows and on my return the smell of cigarette smoke was extremely strong I don t smoke myself and this I found upsetting I called reception and a chamber made arrived with a spray I was told that I could leave the window open In that case I would hear traffic all night or close the window and I hail the fumes Not a good experience in this hotel .  Location. No Negative.  Simple system easy check in and out clean great shower and comfortable bed .  Service in bar.  Room was spacious.  The halls and main rooms look very dated The rooms are nice once you get inside but you feel like you re in an old dorm and not the Renaissance as you re getting from the lobby to your room .  Super friendly staff upon arrival Nice lobby and bar .  A piece of my jewellery went missing it was an expensive and sentimental bracelet that I left on my bedside table before going to the beach for the day When I returned it has been taken and I didn t assume it was taken until I searched the whole room top to bottom I informed the hotel staff who told me that they would get the housekeeper to look I went back a few hours later to see if there was any good news but unfortunately the hotel staff hadn t noted my problem so no search was made and I was greeted by the rudest man I have ever encountered He may as well have said he didn t give a damn about what I was saying and even abruptly told me to slow down as he couldn t understand my accent I have never recieved such bad customer service in my life Not one ounce of concern was given by this hotel member who I believe was the manager and there was no consolation or even an option to be sent my jewellery if it was found Overall a horrible experience and put a downer on my whole holiday .  The terrace in our room was nice .  I had booked a deluxe tower view room and had made contact via telephone to guarantee optimal room for a wedding proposal plan Turned up Was given access card to a room that was already occupied and had people in the room where out baggage and engagement ring had been sent to Then there were no rooms so given a disabled access room 2 floors below overlooking the football pitch Nowhere near what I had booked or paid for and pre arranged Once given that room Bose sound system didn t work and had to call to replace it The maintenance person just let himself into our room and my partner was getting into her robe It was one thing after another and I will list my full experience in a detailed complaint I had set about writing a detailed gym review and have this featured on my site but unless invited back to experience a stay I should have received I have completely given up on any such report .  It was only a 1 night stay.  Shuttle service was poor Shuttle didn t pick up on time There were almost 20 people and just came with 13 seats mini bus Security locker was small I couldn t store my MacB Air in the locker.  Nice staff Breakfast simple but delicious Clean. No Negative.  Wow A gem in Barcelona Lovely restaurant Great location Very cool.  Cost of breakfast was silly 28 euros each per day means we didn t bother and went round the corner for coffee pastries for a third of the cost.  Really nice hotel Clearly very new A few teething issues with the cleaners around replacing dirty coffee cups etc but once they were highlighted the staff could not have been more helpful. No Negative.  Great location Comfortable rooms.  nothing.  I liked everything from the friendly and helpful staff comfort of the hotel and the location The breakfast was one of the best I have had anywhere .  The room was small double bed but pushed against the wall so had to climb over the bed to get in or out which is not ideal if your partner is sleeping.  Hotel was in a good location with a nice choice for breakfast.  parking and the organization with cards and coins is awful because it didnt work as it should.  the bed was excellent and the location is very good.  As it was a special occasion I asked for a room with a bit of a view and ended up looking out on to a brick wall probably worst room they had .  Very comfortable rooms.  There was only enough for one cup or tea in the room There was also only one large towel available and not enough toilet roll The breakfast room was very hot and crowded Hotel in general was very warm.  Enjoyable breakfast Comfortable and clean room Great location to either walk into central or underground very near by Friendly staff It is a good hotel for the price . No Negative.  We stayed one night in this hotel in December This hotel is quite luxurious our room was really beautifully designed The staff at the hotel were particularly friendly and helpful Definitely a nice getaway . No Negative.  Fantastic location and very clean .  Rooms rudimentary.  Location. No Negative.  Full English breakfast was delicious and the staff were all very pleasant .  Room was an executive suite very hard mattress and the room was very tired and in need of care and attention really let themselves down.  The staff and location excellent and the choice of breakfast. No Negative.  The breakfast was very good The bathtub in the room a dream The bed was the most comfortable in ages .  The hotel is on a busy loud street The A C didn t work well in our room it worked fine in our son s room though and while the outside temp was cool enough to compensate we had to close the window because the noise was relentless .  The staff was very hospitable and the breakfast was excellent Really appreciated the electric kettle and refrigerator in our room .  Reception staff friendly but not so professional for a 4 star .  Breakfast was superb .  Nothing to improve on the hotel was perfect for what I needed it for .  The hotel was new and very clean modern and the staff were very polite and helpful even took my bag up to my room It was also a great location for where my course was held There was a good choice for breakfast including fish if you like that There is a gym so you can get a workout in during your stay both hairdryer and ironing board in your wardrobe too Lovely stay . No Negative.  Room was so quiet which is unusual for a large hotel where you can usually hear constant doors banging and people returning to their rooms yelling and shouting None of this in DTAmsterdam Room was large and nice view and modern installations Staff could not do enough for us Staff also are uniformed in excellent attire Free applesand bottled water Would not hesitate to stay there again .  Security needed in entrance .  Nice employee and clean hotel.  Disabled access.  Beds very very comfortable.  Certainly the room was large enough to accommodate a bit more wardrobe space .  Beds extra large lovely garden area Quiet well sized room good restaurant Modern decor Great area .  Happy with everything as the response to minor technical issue with the safe was immediate resolution.  The location and views of Barcelona and marina were stunning the staff friendly and helpful and.  the bedroom and bathroom were small and outdated could do with a revamp.  the staff were very friendly the location was great the breakfast was superb.  Huge pillows my neck hurt all night On the first morning there was no breakfast table available for 6 although we had booked breakfast in advance We had 3 tables of 2 very complicated with our 4 kids The bathrooms are much too small only one person can fit inside Decoration of room is a bit old it should be refreshened carpet curtains shower .  Excellent breakfast Nice and comfortable beds Excellent location.  Bathroom and room was small.  Bed was comfortable . No Negative.  What did we love about this place Everything Bed was so very comfortable staff were very helpful Location is fantastic .  Mattress could do with renewing or turning .  The umbrella offered on the rainy days proved to be a life savour . No Negative.  Very nice place helpful staff and near the underground. No Negative.  Lovely hotel.  Nothing it was perfect .  Everything Easily the best hotel we have ever stayed in 5 stars is not enough From the welcome and glass of prosecco the extra treats in the room the amazing view from the balcony the cool rooftop bar the delicious STK restaurant The list goes on and on P s location for London sights and shopping is also 10 10 Special mention about the concierge Luis I have never met someone who understands excellent customer service as he does personal warming and made our stay so special Thank you .  Problems with WIFI.  Wonderful friendly staff .  Staff was horrible front desk wasn t helpful and very rude only night services was great daytime stuffshould left this hotel with 2 no more.  Location room.  Noisy at night disturbed my sleep.  Location.  It was 4 people of my family and we booked 2rooms However the room was far from the other one I wish the rooms were next to each other .  I had dinner on the first night and breakfast next day It was very nice .  We had dinner and breakfast included in our room rate both were OK but no better than that At dinner no member of staff offered us a drink and there wasn t even any water included A soft drink was 5 While the suite we had was lovely some things were a little impractical like no shelf in the bathroom to put your toiletries Minor but annoying There isn t much going on in the local area .  We got upgraded to a suite which was amazing Bigger than our flat at home with access to a roof terrace overlooking the station which was lovely The location is very convenient if you re arriving into Milan central station Hotel looks very new and modern Check out time was fairly late and the hotel stored our luggage for us .  Cooked breakfast could have been hotter Bacon hard left standing too long.  Very comfortable bed spotlessly clean room.  3 hours late check in Too many staff behind the desk not interacting with customers. No Positive. No Negative.  location was very good.  The breakfast area is probably too small as everyone seem to want to eat at the same time This also resulted in the need to wait a bit at the buffet We usually do breakfast early this time we didn t so perhaps that s just normal when everyone seems to go at 9am .  The room was very clean modern and roomy we were on the ground floor which made it very quiet and private with no passing traffic except the emergency exit Initially I found the location a bit off putting being in a basement area but then I realized the advantage and really liked it The staff were all very friendly and helpful a real bonus compared to my last London hotel We also had dinner in the lounge and the food and service were excellent .  Wi Fi should be free for that price of Hotel. No Positive. No Negative.  Comfortable bed tea coffee facilities very clean .  Room not ready at 15H noise from other rooms above no mini bar breakfast too expensive compared to content .  Location.  Very run down old furniture and disgusting old stainy carpets everywhere Terrible unstable wifi plus no free wifi even in the executive room .  Good location for CW close to the tube and DLR too.  Nothing .  Great value for money . No Negative.  Tasty breakfast . No Negative.  The staff super friendly .  Building work externally.  Comfortable room and bed.  Some of the staff were very rude especially the general Manager and made us feel very stressed during our vacation . No Positive.  wifi connection.  clean.  The only thing I could fault with our room is I would have liked the door to the bathroom to be solid and not have slats .  This is a lovely boutique hotel that is in a great location with wonderful staff It has a lovely ambiance we just loved it The staff are very helpful thank you Martin and the breakfast is delicious We were fortunate to have a lovely view from our room I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it to others . No Negative.  Location was a big factor being right next to a tube station that s on the circle and Piccadilly lines Attentive staff in the hotel and comfortable room Also the breakfast was very good . No Negative.  Friendly staff As the metro is around the corner it was easy to get around The room was small overlooked Russel square and met all my needs.  The bathroom it s too small and not private at all only a glass separes it from the room .  The bed the breakfast and the views . No Negative.  Very nice modern hotel with large and clean rooms It is in the heart of Prater just 50 meters from the metro The staff is charming Very good price value scale .  Check out time is a little be early .  Excellent .  Staff ware arogon. No Positive. No Negative.  Very nice interior delicious food great location very friendly staff We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel and will definetely come back .  Wi Fi is completely awful and no fridge in the room .  Staff is friendly and room service is great .  Although not far from Lamarck metro If I were critical I d say the location was a little effort to get to involving climbing some steps with luggage if we took the shortest route.  Brand new hotel Very high specification and visually stunning after all each room is a photo studio Friendly professional and security conscious staff. No Negative.

The staff is excellent Ready to help always The food was very good fresh and the idea of supper is also very good the hotel is very clean the rooms are big enough One get full value for money ,\n  By stander infront of mcdo.  Very affordable hotel in paris with pool transfort nearby,\n  Had to pay extra on departure apparently bookings com gave us the wrong price .  Great room and location for winter wonderland and shopping,\n  Only buffet food for a kitchen open till 10 30 this is pretty poor for a hotel which has 300 plus room At least have a bar menu were i can order some snacks .  The room,\n  Almost had to put up with the room for wheelchair people although they claimed it is a standard room but I d be very upset if I hadn t got to change to a normal standard room .  Location was good modern building great views if u get the right rooms Staff has been very friendly and helpful ,\n  The only let down was the shower not very strong and the view was less than desired but that may have been my fault as I requested a quiet room .  The breakfast was wonderful so fresh and a wide variety the location was awesome and so much to see and great restaurants dotted around And the receptionist was delightful and helpful The positives FAR OUTWAY the negatives,\n No Negative.  Hotel is in an excellent location with bus and tube station 2 minutes away The room was small but finished to a very high standard The staff were extremely friendly and helpful The only downside was there was no bar in the hotel but it should be completed soon ,\n  The electrics were a little unpredictable something put to charge didn t charge change to another socket and success Use the same working socket later on and it wouldn t work but a different socket would Odd .  The friendliness of the staff the inclusion of wine tasting and snacks in the evening brought guests together The room was spacious stylish and well equipped with rooftop views Would enjoy staying here again ,\n  All in all good but a little impersonal check in process but very nice check out Breakfast is very expensive if not included in the price but is excellent .  Bed and bathroom excellent and the view from the breakfast room alone worth a stay ,\n  Breakfast is still expensive .  Just a few steps from Prater comfortable large rooms nice wellness area on the top ,\n  Nothing.  Everything,\n  the bed was making squeaking noise. No Positive,\n  Wasn t made clear at all about the swimming pool and its facilities No mention of changing rooms lockers etc or even if there was a charge to use it .  Environment atmosphere and room and facilities,\n  Nothing.  Bed was comfortable,\n  There was no lounge area.  Bed was very comfortable Breakfast area was very nice Location ,\n  Nothing.  Room layout quiet area comfy bed lovely food in the restaurant,\n  This is a tired hotel and how it can be referred to as boutique as it s part of the Hyatt chain is anyones guess The rooms we re ok but not well looked after with splashes of paint on the walls with the toilet sounding like a steam train as it uses some sort of vacuum method which takes a minimum of two flushes unique experience but not a good one The glass next to the lift was smashed the booking in process is literally in the dark in that the staff have to help as you can t see what your doing due to poor lighting The room whilst adequate in size for a short stay was again tired with paint splashes on walls toilet seat in need of replacement and the phone in the bathroom of poor quality and definitely not giving the place a 5 star feeling What really shocked me was the 5 star rating no way 5 star prices in that the breakfast was an eye watering and shocking 31 50 This is a 3 possibly due to it s location and 7 restaurants 4 stars but having travelled quite a bit it can t be classed as 5 stars .  Staff were helpful and friendly The hotel is situated next to the Liverpool Street mainline and underground stations with historic sites eateries pubs and the famous Spitalfields only a minutes walk Valet parking is available for 45 00 The hotel has 7 restaurants ,\n  Nil.  The service was to a very good standard The location of the hotel allowed for easy access to the tube with only a 5 minute walk ,\n  The cocktail bar gets very busy particularly late in the evening and so the service declines accordingly which is a pity More bar staff would help obviously .  very comfortable beds good check in friendly staff nice cocktails fast lifts free Smarties and right next door to the venue for the gig we went to which is why we chose this hotel ,\n  The room we initially had did not smell very nice and we had to be moved .  The room was very nice and d cor pleasing,\n  Nothing.  I liked the location of the hotel very near to amsterdam sloterdijk train station where u can reach amsterdam central station one stop only and from there u can go everywhere also its 10 min by train from the airport and 20 min by taxi I liked too the decor of the hotel generally especially the room rooms are very comfortable The staff was very friendly and always smiling ,\n  When we reached we booked a smoking room facility but there was a lot of noise i think they were doing maintenance it was shock for us then we called and asked to stop it they said it will be stopped around 5pm and we checked it around 12pm so they changed the room for us but with no smoking facility which makes us go the roof or stand outside the hotel to smoke it doesn t bother us much since we were outside all the time .  The Location was perfect the staff were so friendly and helpful the roof was amazing and the view was so beautiful the shower was so good and the hot water was amazing the breakfast was perfect with variety of cheese and bread it was so calm and there was nothing to bother at all i recommend it for people with enough budget ,\n No Negative.  friendly staff helping me to clarify invoice and help with how get to town and all 3 ladies very beautiful ,\n  No hot water window at a construction place elevator didn t work room smells like sigaret bathroom for handicapped people wasn t comfortable. No Positive,\n  Booked a three bed room which wasnt available when we arrived Fortunately a co worker had a twin room and was able to accommodate the third person We accepted this for the first night of eight nights and checked on two more occasions whether we needed to change to our triple room We were told we could stay put if we liked and they would leave us in those rooms despite the fact the accommodating co worker was checking out one night before us We were happy with that as the rooms were well positioned Then on the last night no one seemed to be aware of this agreement due to lack of communication between their staff We were told one of the rooms had to be vacated because they were fully booked and they also had no triple rooms available despite out booking We had to pack our co workers belongings out and after we some discussion they placed us in a disabled room that could accommodate a third bed They also refunded the difference between a double and a triple room for the duration of our stay and threw in the safe key charge for free after we demanded they discuss that with the manager .

Limpio y cercano a Diagonal,\n  The single room was really small and felt like needed a refresh.  Great location and staff,\n  The only thing I suppose I could say bad about the hotel was the price of drinks from the mini bar in our room were Very Expensive But that s not much of a problem as there is a Tesco Express practically next door .  We stayed here as we were seeing a show at the 02 which is just one stop away on the tube Just a 2 minute walk over a footbridge is the Canary Wharf tube station Which is also connected to a shopping centre Breakfast was Lovely The bar area and restaurant also Good ,\n  Bar prices extortionate Wanted to eat at the hotel restaurant but could not work out if it was open or not Bar staff seemed very grumpy and seemed they really didn t want to be there .

One of the best staff I ve seen very friendly and knowledgeable ,\n  Staff could have been more pleasant .  It was an okay experience nothing to shout about Have stayed in many starred hotel all around esp in Asia and felt dissapointed with this hotel Location was great but everything was was just avearge They should improve on the front desk services ,\n  room service was not a very pleasant experience the person who came was rude and he didnt like it when i sent an item back because it wasnt what i ordered the 23rd floor pool area i dont understand why there was only 7 sunbeds there when there are 26 floors filled with guests that wants to get the chance to sit there i know there is another pool on the third floor but it is also very tiny and felt weird swimming there if there was one other person swimming as well because you came so close to eachother in the pool Princess Barcelona sells this hotel with its sea views and pools but they were both a disappointment view of the ugly museum roof was not very nice i didnt think it would be so visible at the 16th floor but it was and the rooms walls were very scrached made it not so fresh feeling .  we loved the location most of the staff and the bed was very comfortable Reception was very helpfull and was very nice comfortable bed its very close to subway nd beach too the mini bar was free and they refill it everyday with couple of drinks and you are always met a very friendly face in the entrance everytime you go in and out ,\n  Small dirty room Rip off price .

booking com We stayed for 6 nights in this hotel from 11 to 17 July Upon arrival we were placed in a small room on the 2nd floor of the hotel It turned out that this was not the room we booked I had specially reserved the 2 level duplex room so that we would have a big windows and high ceilings The room itself was ok if you don t mind the broken window that can not be closed hello rain and a mini fridge that contained some sort of a bio weapon at least i guessed so by the smell of it I intimately asked to change the room and after explaining 2 times that i booked a duplex btw it costs the same as a simple double but got way more volume due to the high ceiling was offered a room but only the next day SO i had to check out the next day before 11 o clock in order to get the room i waned to Not the best way to begin your holiday So we had to wait till 13 00 in order to check in my new room what a wonderful waist of my time The room 023 i got was just as i wanted to peaceful internal garden view big window We were tired from waiting the room so we placed our belongings and rushed to the city In the evening it turned out that there was a constant noise in the room i guess it was made by vibrating vent tubes or something it was constant and annoying as hell AND it did not stop even at 2 am making it hard to fall asleep for me and my wife I have an audio recording that i can not attach here but if you want i can send it via e mail The next day the technician came but was not able to determine the cause of the disturbing sound so i was offered to change the room once again the hotel was fully booked and they had only 1 room left the one that was smaller but seems newer ","Review_Total_Negative_Word_Counts":397,"Total_Number_of_Reviews":1403,"Positive_Review":" Only the park

the rooms are clean enough for me When we got in our room we immediately notice there s something wet and sticky like juice or something just next to our bed We called the front desk and they said they will send a cleaning lady to us We waited at least half an hour and no one showed up We had to go to the front desk and complain again When we got back later in the evening the juice has been removed but there s still some hair on the spot We were however no interest to complain anymore Also on the wall in the room on the curtain and in the bathroom there s a lot of stains which I had to ignore the whole time I didn t feel comfortable at all The staff at front desk are very friendly However I guess they pay really bad to their cleaning ladies First you will not be greeted by the cleaning staffs if you run into one at the hallway What more annoying is that I got woke up at 7 in the morning by the cleaning ladies because they closed the doors so loudly when they were cleaning other rooms And they didn t close it loudly just once but for at least on hour They kept open and close the door I was really annoyed I was in my holiday and I just wanted to have a good sleep at least The parking place was small but ok When we arrived the ticket machine was broken Someone told us we don t need a ticket to get in for now and we just have to inform the front desk when we check in We did so and paid for 2 days when we checked out When we drove out the ticket machine was broken again So we didn t actually have to plug in the ticket which we have paid with a lot of money Of course we should pay for it because we parked there but still I was not so happy because I have the feeling that I paid for nothing
